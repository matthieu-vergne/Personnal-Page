<h1>Generic Programming in Java:<br/>The Basics of Java Generics</h1>

<p>
Usually, when speaking about Java, resources about Generic Programming focuses on the use of generics, although we saw in <a href="entry:4">a previous post</a> that it is not the only way to make generic programs.
For instance, <a href="#Mathur2011">Mathur</a> go as far as saying that <cite>Generic programming can be seen simply as the act of using type parameters</cite>, speaking mainly about generics when speaking about Java.
This is however an <a href="entry:4">over simplistic view of the task</a>, and Mathur somehow recognises it immediately after this sentence with a broader definition, but the paper remains on this restricted perspective.
We have nothing against Mathur, of course, but this paper is illustrative of a pathological behaviour in the Java community: people looking for "Generic Programming in Java" on their favorite search engine will mainly find resources about what are generics and how to use them for a program to compile.
Yet, generics have been introduced in Java to improve type checking at compile time, not to unlock the ability to make generic programs in the broad sense: the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/why.html">Oracle tutorial</a> may say so, but what can be done with generics can be done without them by using the type <code>Object</code> and proper casting.
This is what was done before the introduction of generics, with what is called now <a hreaf="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/rawTypes.html">raw types</a>: it was important to remain retrocompatible with "generic" programs of the time, but generics only improve the <em>already present</em> ability to make generic programs, it does not <em>bestow</em> it.
</p>

<p>
This confusion between generic programs (the broad sense) and generics (Java generic types and methods) is now established, which is why we mainly find resources about generics when we want to learn about Generic Programming in Java.
But here we go beyond this confusion: our aim is to make generic programs, not to use a given generic feature only, but if we speak about Generic Programming in Java in a significantly different way than other people, the reader might just get confused.
To remain consistent with current practice, we speak about Generic Programming in Java in the usual way, with a principal focus on the use of generics, and keep more advanced techniques for future posts about <em>Advanced</em> Generic Programming in Java.
Oracle provides <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html">a complete lesson about generics</a>, so we will let interested people look around to master the feature.
In this post, we will focus on the fundamental properties of generics that we can use for more advanced techniques, highlighting practical advantages and limitations that one can face in practice, while future posts will dig in the advanced techniques themselves.
</p>

<h2>What are Generics?</h2>

<p>
Generics has been introduced in Java 5 to <cite>add stability to your code by making more of your bugs detectable at compile time</cite>, dixit the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/">Oracle tutorial</a>.
Like a method <code>print(String text)</code> tells that a textual value should be provided to the method, but let the user choose what the actual value of this text is, generics tell that a type (class or interface) should be provided, but let the user choose which one.
</p>
<!-- TODO Inspire from Oracle tutorial -->

<h3>Generic Methods</h3>

<p>
A generic method is a method which uses one or more generics to specify types of variables to use within this method:
</p>
<pre><code>
public class Checker {
	public &lt;T> T check(T value, T defaultValue) {
		if (value == null) {
			return defaultValue;
		} else {
			return value;
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The <code>check()</code> method specifies two arguments of type <code>T</code> and returns the very same type of argument.
<code>T</code> can correspond to any type, the only constraint being that each argument and the returned value have the same type.
A method using no generics would need to take and return <code>Object</code> instances, but then we would miss the compiler check, for instance returning <code>""+value</code> instead of <code>value</code> would be perfectly legal, and the error would be catched only at runtime.
If we instantiate a <code>checker</code> instance and call <code>checker.check("test", "default")</code>, it will return a <code>String</code> instance corresponding to the first argument (because it is not null).
If, with the same instance, we call <code>checker.check(1, 0)</code>, it will return an <code>Integer</code> (equals to 1) because the returned type is aligned with the type of the arguments.
If we call <code>checker.check(null, "Oops!")</code>, although we don't know the type of the first argument (which is null), the second argument is a <code>String</code>, which is why the returned value is a <code>String</code> too (this time corresponding to the second argument).
</p>

<p>
In this example, the type is implicitly inferred from the arguments, and it is trivial because they were all of the same type.
But calling <code>checker.check(1, "default")</code> is also valid, because although they do not have the same type, they have a <em>parent</em> type in common, which is <code>Object</code>.
Consequently, they are still considered as instances of the same type and the returned value is considered to be an <code>Object</code> instance.
If we want to enforce the type to be <code>String</code>, we can do it by calling <code>checker.&lt;String>check(1, "default")</code>, which is an explicit typing of the method and makes this code invalid.
</p>

<p>
It is also worth knowing that constructors can have their own generics as well, thus making them generic constructors.
</p>

<h3>Generic Types</h3>

<p>
Generic methods are nice, but the generics of a given method are independent from the generics of another, even if they have the same name.
If we want several methods to share their generics, we need to share the type information in some ways.
One way to do is by assigning generics to the whole class by making it a generic type:
</p>
<pre><code>
public class Storage&lt;T> {
	private T value;

	public void set(T value) {
		this.value = value;
	}

	public T get() {
		return value;
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Here, not only the <code>set()</code> method builds on a customisable type <code>T</code>, but also the method <code>get()</code> and the member <code>value</code>.
Because all these <code>T</code> correspond to the generics specified at the class level, they are all the same, which means that if <code>T</code> is <code>Integer</code>, then the method <code>set()</code> only accepts an <code>Integer</code> value, the member is itself considered as an <code>Integer</code>, and the value returned by <code>get()</code> is again an <code>Integer</code>.
Instantiating an <code>intStorage = new Storage&lt;Integer>()</code> for example allows to call <code>intStorage.set(1)</code> but not <code>intStorage.set("test")</code>.
</p>

<h3>Multiple Generics</h3>

<p>
Generic methods and types can specify several generics, for instance <code>Storage&lt;T1, T2></code> could be used to store 2 values, one of type <code>T1</code> and another of type <code>T2</code> (with the set/get methods for each value).
However, a limitation of generic types and methods is that they can only manage a finite (and preferably short) amount of generics at a time.
This is enough for homogeneous objects, like our <code>Storage&lt;T></code> example which is supposed to store a single type of instance.
But if we want to implement an heterogeneous object, like a map which has a different type of item depending on the key, then doing so with a generic type requires to use <code>Object</code> (or the most generic we need) to be able to store them, thus cancelling compiler checking.
To allow an arbitrary number of types, one needs to exploit the independency of generic methods and, because generic methods are independent, the type need to be stored and retrieved in another way.
People interested in this kind of container may look at the <a href="entry:7">Heterogenous Generic Type</a>, which deals exactly with this issue.
</p>

<h3>Bounded Generics</h3>

<p>
So far we saw that generic methods usually infer implicitly the type to use based on the code, but we can also state it explicitly to constrain the compiler to accept only a given type of value.
Similarly, a generic type can be instantiated by specifying which type to be used at instantiation time, which is then checked upon the call of each method of the instance.
However, rather than accepting any type of object, and constrain it only when upon instantiation or method call, we might prefer to assume some constraints from the start to ensure that we receive instances which support some features, like the following method:
</p>
<pre><code>
public class Checker {
	public &lt;T extends Number> T check(T value, T defaultValue) {
		...
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The code remains exactly the same, but calling the method with <code>String</code> instances will be invalid, while calls with <code>Integer</code> or <code>Float</code> instances will be valid.
By bounding the generics to a specific type, it is then guaranteed that some methods will be available, like here <code>Number</code> implies to have access to the method <code>intValue()</code>.
This means that the <code>T</code> instances can exploit these methods, for instance <code>value.intValue() + defaultValue.intValue()</code>.
Bounding generics thus act as a way to ensure that the designed code is designed for specific uses, while a generic code should try to limit the bounding as much as possible, remove it in the best case.
</p>

<p>
Although the keyword is <code>extends</code>, it does not apply only to classes which <em>extend</em> other classes, or interfaces which <em>extend</em> other interfaces, but also to classes which <em>implement</em> interfaces.
It is also possible to bound the generics to several classes or interfaces, like <code>&lt;T extends Serializable &amp; Cloneable &amp; Comparable&lt;T>></code>, which means that <code>T</code> should extend or implement <em>all</em> the classes or interfaces listed.
Because Java cannot extend more than one class, only one class can be used to bound a generics and it should be listed first, while any number of interfaces can be added.
Notice the <code>Comparable&lt;T></code>, which uses the generics it is bounding: generics can be used to bound other generics as well as themselves.
</p>

<h3>Wildcard <code>?</code></h3>

<p>
Although generics provide a useful way to constrain the type of a variable in various ways, some constraints are not worth the introduction of a generics.
For example:
</p>
<pre><code>
public &lt;T> void print(List&lt;T> list) {
	for (T item : list) {
		System.out.println(item);
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
This method allows to print the items contained in the list on the console, but no concrete use is made of <code>T</code>: any instance can be used in this way, thus leading to wonder whether it is worth to specify it in the first place.
A usual mistake would be to think that, because we use the items as <code>Object</code> instances, we might as well replace <code>T</code> by <code>Object</code>, but it enforces <code>list</code> to be a <code>List&lt;Object></code>, thus forbiding to use this method on a <code>List&lt;Integer></code> for example.
This is because there is no inheritance link between a <code>List&lt;Object></code> and a <code>List&lt;Integer></code> (see <a href="#mix_class_and_generics_inheritance">here</a> for an explanation).
In this case, we don't want to constrain the <code>List</code> to be on a specific type of items, we explicitly want it to be on <em>any</em> type of item, which is achieved by using the wildcard <code>?</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>
public void print(List&lt;?> list) {
	for (Object item : list) {
		System.out.println(item);
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
We can see that the items are considered as <code>Object</code> instances anyway, but the list is not constrained anymore and can accept <code>List&lt;Object></code> as well as <code>List&lt;Integer></code> lists.
Only the items will be considered with the most generic type possible, which is <code>Object</code> here because the wildcard is unbounded.
It is possible to bound the wildcard in the same way than generics with <code>extends</code>, such that <code>List&lt;? extends Number></code> will accept any <code>List&lt;Integer></code> or <code>List&lt;Float></code> but reject <code>List&lt;String></code>.
The items are, consequently, considered as <code>Number</code>, and methods provided by this class can be used.
</p>

<p>
Although it happens far less frequently, it is also possible to say that a wildcard should accept any type equal or <em>parent</em> of <code>Number</code> (for our example) by replacing <code>extends</code> by <code>super</code>.
While <code>extends</code> usually applies to parameters used as <em>inputs</em>, like the list we read in the previous example, <code>super</code> usually applies to parameters used as <em>outputs</em>, like the example below:
</p>
<pre><code>
public void print(List&lt;? super Number> list) {
	list.add(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Indeed, we say here that we want a list able to accept any <code>Number</code> instances, which can be achieved by a <code>List&lt;Number></code> or a <code>List&lt;Object></code>, but not by a <code>List&lt;Integer></code> (a <code>Float</code> is not accepted despite being also a <code>Number</code>).
Because this constraint means that the list can accept <em>at least</em> <code>Number</code> instances, it could contain anything else too, and thus calling <code>list.get(index)</code> returns an instance recognised as an <code>Object</code>, not a <code>Number</code>.
If one want to have both a lower and an upper bound to the wildcard, one should prefer to use generics, as shown <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/29451739/2031083">here</a>, because Java does not allow to use <code>super</code> and <code>extends</code> together.
<!-- TODO Is it a technical limitation or is it justified? -->
Other limitations can occur, like the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/capture.html">wildcard capture</a> errors, but the interested reader can dig in the linked material for more information.
Interested people can also consider <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/wildcardGuidelines.html">these guidelines</a> to figure out how to use wildcards in there code.
</p>

(TODO: Here starts another post about differences between generics and generic programming)

<h2>What are Generics Good For?</h2>

<p>
As we saw, generics aim for providing to the compiler the required information to properly check the code despite delegating the choice of the type to a later time (instantiation for generic types, call for generic methods).
As such, it allows to specify constraints like which types should be aligned
</p>
<!-- TODO -->

<h2>Usual Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<p>
We do not speak here about pieces of code that do not compile, but valid uses of generics which nevertheless show that something has gone wrong in the design, what one would call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">anti-pattern</a>.
</p>

<h3>Specify useless bounds</h3>

<p>
Bounding generics is useful to ensure that only a given kind of instances is used, but producing generic code implies to seek for the least specific design.
In particular, the bounding of generics should be motivated by their use: if a generic method bounds a generics to <code>List</code> but only uses its <code>iterator()</code> method, then the generics is over constrained.
In this situation, <code>List</code> should be replaced by <code>Iterable</code>, which is the one specifying the <code>iterator()</code> method.
For a generic type, the reasoning applies on the whole class or interface which specifies it: if the class or interface use nothing specific to the bounding type, then a parent class or interface should be considered or the bounding should be simply removed.
</p>

<p>
A tricky case is the bounding in interfaces and abstract classes, which are supposed to be extended: one may think that the bounding is motivated because we expect child classes to use these features.
But one should not forget that any child class can apply a more restricted bounding to the generics its parent requires, thus ensuring that the relevant methods are available at the child level.
So although programming with generics does not forbid it, producing generic programs does: if the current level does not motivate for such bounding, such bounding is irrelevant at the current level.
Consequently, a generic programmer should seek for the least bounded definition, which allows to use the class or interface in the most various contexts.
This is an application of the <a href="entry:6">information layering</a> assumption.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the introduction of default methods in Java 8 allows to implement methods in interfaces, which can then be used as a motivation for bounding the generics.
However, default methods are the ones which should be motivated based on the aim of the interface, not the reverse.
For example, it makes sense for an abstract class having no member to be transformed into an interface with default methods, because it was designed with a functional purpose in mind.
Nevertheless, aiming for a more generic design remain a goal of the generic programmer, and if two designs allows the same extensions, then the most generic one should be preferred.
</p>

<h3>Specify useless generics</h3>

<p>
Pushing the reasoning of useless bounding further, which is an example of removal of useless constraints, one should pay attention to useless generics, which is another example of useless constraints.
As we saw, generics helps the compiler to align types of instances, but if no such alignment is required, then generics are not required either.
For example:
</p>
<pre><code>
public &lt;T> void print(T object) {
	System.out.println("Object recieved: " + object);
}
</code></pre>

<p>
This method specifies a generics <code>T</code> for the instance <code>object</code>, but this instance is never used in a situation where the type <code>T</code> is required.
In such a case, the generics should be replaced by its bound, so <code>T extends Number</code> sould be replaced by <code>Number</code>, or by <code>Object</code> if it is unbounded.
This preference comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">law of parsimony</a>, or for a more software-oriented reasoning the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS principle</a>.
By simply requiring an <code>Object</code>, one does not have to care about the generics, while by adding the generics <code>T</code>, additional care must be provided regarding which type to choose when calling the method.
This is particularly obvious for a generic type: if a generic type specifies a useless generics, people will still have to ask themselves which type to use when instantiating or extending it.
</p>

<p>
An exception to this rule is the use of multiple bounds: Java does not allow a parameter or a returned value to be a composition of several types, at the opposite of a generics <code>T extends A &amp; B &amp; C</code>.
It is possible to do it without generics by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern">adapter design pattern</a>: the adapter implements the various interfaces the method requires, and any instance implementing all the interfaces can be wrapped into an adapter instance before to be provided to the method.
In order to avoid such extra work, a generics can be used as a reliable way to fulfil this requirement.
</p>

<p>
It is important to understand that a useless generics is a design issue, not an implementation issue: if this design is imposed by an interface that we implement, then such a design choice should not be argued because of this specific implementation.
At best, we can argue about the relevance of implementing this interface, or implementing it in this way, but the relevance of the design of this method should be considered at the interface level, where it is required.
This is again an application of the <a href="entry:6">information layering</a> assumption.
</p>

<h3>Omit generics (raw types)</h3>

<p>
Raw types are generic types for which we omit to specify the type at instantiation time, like <code>new Storage()</code> which omits to tell which type of data is stored.
These raw types act as if we provide the most generic type possible<!-- wildcard rather than most generic? -->, so <code>new Storage&lt;Object>()</code> in this example, or <code>new Storage&lt;Number>()</code> if the class is bounded to <code>Number</code> types only.
However, it only does so loosely: a raw type is not strictly specified, for instance while the compiler complains with <code>Storage&lt;Object> s = new Storage&lt;String>()</code>, it does not for <code>Storage s = new Storage&lt;String>()</code>.
This behaviour is for retrocompatibility with legacy code made before Java 5, when generics did not exist yet.
Consequently, you may then write <code>s.set(1)</code>, which only generates a warning but fails at runtime because you provide an <code>Integer</code> instead of a <code>String</code>.
</p>

<p>
If we ignore the technical details which allow such weakness in the compiler checking, one may instead rely on a conceptual explanation: Java is a strongly (or statically) typed language, so the type is supposed to be chosen based on what one needs to do with it.
As such, generics allow to delegate the choice of the type to the instantiation time, while raw typing simply refuses to take this decision, which breaks the strong typing assumption.
One may argue that it is also true for generic methods which can infer the type implicitly from the data, but a generic method call is atomic: all the information is there, we cannot "loose" it.
At the opposite, a generic type spread the type information over all its methods, which can be used far away from each other, thus allowing to loose the relevant information.
</p>

<p>
A last justification is that, for advanced generic programming, a particular care is needed to identify the right concepts to use.
<!-- TODO Link to dedicated post about that -->
Consequently, refusing to decide which type to use is not a behaviour compatible with a generic programming mindset.
</p>

<h2>Why Java Generics Are Not All About Generic Programs?</h2>

<p>
There is two evidences to provide to show that generics and generic programs are different things: by showing that generic programs do not require generics, and by showing that generics do not require programs to be generic.
We show here an example for each of them.
</p>

<p>
As mentionned, generics have been introduced with Java 5 in 2004, but people were already able to make generic programs before this introduction.
<code>ArrayList</code> for example was introduced in Java 2, and at that time was dealing with <code>Object</code> items, as shown by the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase12-419414.html#7549-j2sdk-1.2.2_006-doc-oth-JPR">Java 2 documentation</a>.
This is how it was able to deal with any kind of instances, and this was possible because it needs no information about the item itself.
Surely, it was possible to add a <code>String</code> to a list which should contain only <code>Integer</code> instances without even a warning, meaning that this kind of mistakes should be checked at run time, but it was already possible to implement generic classes without generics.
This class, and all the classes which existed before Java 5 and were refined to use generics from this version, provide a great evidence that generics are not a requirement for generic programming in the broad sense.
</p>

<p>
The other way around, and probably the most striking example of it, is made by <a href="#Giovannelli2013">Giovannelli</a>, who makes a really good point by comparing the <cite>parametric polymorphism</cite> and <cite>ad-hoc polymorphism</cite> of <a href="#Strachey2000">Strachey</a>.
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/polymorphism.html">Polymorphism in Java</a> is the ability for a piece of data to be treated in different ways by changing its type.
For example, an instance of <code>LinkedList</code> can be stored in a variable of type <code>LinkedList</code>, <code>List</code>, <code>Collection</code>, and many other compatible types, and any instance can be treated as an <code>Object</code> independently of its actual type.
The <em>actual</em> type of the instance is obviously an instantiable class, but the <em>apparent</em> type of the instance (i.e. the type of the variable which stores it) decides what is visible at that time (the <code>LinkedList</code> methods of the instance are unavailable if we store it in a <code>Collection</code> variable).
Parametric polymorphism is a polymorphism which only cares about the <em>apparent</em> type of the instance, like <code>LinkedList&lt;T>.addFirst(T item)</code> which adds <code>item</code> at the beginning of the list, whatever it is.
Ad hoc polymorphism, at the opposite, simply hides the type-specific details, like the following method:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;T> T add(T a, T b) {
	if (a instanceof Integer) {
		// Add 2 integers
		return (T) new Integer((Integer) a + (Integer) b);
	} else if (a instanceof Float) {
		// Add 2 floats
		return (T) new Float((Float) a + (Float) b);
	} else if (a instanceof String) {
		// Concatenate 2 strings
		return (T) ((String) a + (String) b);
	} else {
		throw new RuntimeException("Unmanaged type: " + a.getClass());
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
We can criticise this method in several ways, but let's focus on the polymorphism aspect.
With this code, it is true that the method can receive any type, but this is an example of code which needs to know the <em>actual</em> type of the instance to be implemented.
This is an example of program which uses generics while it is not generic in the broad sense, because it only manages the implemented types, not any type for which such a method would make sense (e.g. <code>Double</code> and <code>Long</code> are not managed).
This is again an evidence that generics is not all what there is to make generic programs.
