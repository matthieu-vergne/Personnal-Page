<h1>Generic Programming in Java:<br/>The Basics of Java Generics</h1>

<p>
Generics has been introduced in Java 5 to <cite>add stability to your code by making more of your bugs detectable at compile time</cite>, dixit the <a href="#OracleTutorial">Oracle tutorial</a>.
Like a method <code>print(String text)</code> tells that a textual value should be provided to the method, but let the caller choose what the actual value of this text is, generics tell that a type (class or interface) should be provided, but let the caller choose which one.
Generics and Generic Programming <a href="entry:9">are different</a>, but the confusion between generic programs (the broad sense) and generics (Java generic types and methods) is now established, which is why we mainly find resources about generics when searching about Generic Programming in Java.
Our global aim is to make generic programs, not to use a given generic feature only, but doing so in Java without speaking using generics would be a mistake, because of the great control they offer for constructing generic programs.
Oracle provides <a href="#OracleTutorial">a complete tutorial about generics</a>, so we let interested people look around to master the feature and focus this post on a summary of the fundamental properties of generics.
</p>

<h2>Generic Methods</h2>

<p>
A generic method is a method which uses one or more generics to specify types of variables to use within this method:
</p>
<pre><code>
public class Checker {
	public &lt;T> T check(T value, T defaultValue) {
		if (value == null) {
			return defaultValue;
		} else {
			return value;
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The <code>check()</code> method specifies two arguments of type <code>T</code> and returns the very same type of argument.
<code>T</code> can correspond to any type, the only constraint being that each argument and the returned value have the same type.
A method using no generics would need to take and return <code>Object</code> instances, but then we would miss the compiler check, for instance returning <code>""+value</code> instead of <code>value</code> would be perfectly legal, and the error would be catched only at runtime.
If we instantiate a <code>checker</code> instance and call <code>checker.check("test", "default")</code>, it will return a <code>String</code> instance corresponding to the first argument (because it is not null).
If, with the same instance, we call <code>checker.check(1, 0)</code>, it will return an <code>Integer</code> (equals to 1) because the returned type is aligned with the type of the arguments.
If we call <code>checker.check(null, "Oops!")</code>, although we don't know the type of the first argument (which is null), the second argument is a <code>String</code>, which is why the returned value is a <code>String</code> too (this time corresponding to the second argument).
</p>

<p>
In this example, the type is implicitly inferred from the arguments, and it is trivial because they were all of the same type.
But calling <code>checker.check(1, "default")</code> is also valid, because although they do not have the same type, they have a <em>parent</em> type in common, which is <code>Object</code>.
Consequently, they are still considered as instances of the same type and the returned value is considered to be an <code>Object</code> instance.
If we want to enforce the type to be <code>String</code>, we can do it by calling <code>checker.&lt;String>check(1, "default")</code>, which is an explicit typing of the method and makes this code invalid.
</p>

<p>
It is also worth knowing that constructors can have their own generics as well, thus making them generic constructors.
</p>

<h2>Generic Types</h2>

<p>
Generic methods are nice, but the generics of a given method are independent from the generics of another, even if they have the same name.
If we want several methods to share their generics, we need to share the type information in some ways.
One way to do is by assigning generics to the whole class by making it a generic type:
</p>
<pre><code>
public class Storage&lt;T> {
	private T value;

	public void set(T value) {
		this.value = value;
	}

	public T get() {
		return value;
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Here, not only the <code>set()</code> method builds on a customisable type <code>T</code>, but also the method <code>get()</code> and the member <code>value</code>.
Because all these <code>T</code> correspond to the generics specified at the class level, they are all the same, which means that if <code>T</code> is <code>Integer</code>, then the method <code>set()</code> only accepts an <code>Integer</code> value, the member is itself considered as an <code>Integer</code>, and the value returned by <code>get()</code> is again an <code>Integer</code>.
Instantiating an <code>intStorage = new Storage&lt;Integer>()</code> for example allows to call <code>intStorage.set(1)</code> but not <code>intStorage.set("test")</code>.
</p>

<h2>Multiple Generics</h2>

<p>
Generic methods and types can specify several generics, for instance <code>Storage&lt;T1, T2></code> could be used to store 2 values, one of type <code>T1</code> and another of type <code>T2</code> (with the set/get methods for each value).
However, a limitation of generic types and methods is that they can only manage a finite (and preferably short) amount of generics at a time.
This is enough for homogeneous objects, like our <code>Storage&lt;T></code> example which is supposed to store a single type of instance.
But if we want to implement an heterogeneous object, like a map which has a different type of item depending on the key, then doing so with a generic type requires to use <code>Object</code> (or the most generic we need) to be able to store them, thus cancelling compiler checking.
To allow an arbitrary number of types, one needs to exploit the independency of generic methods and, because generic methods are independent, the type need to be stored and retrieved in another way.
People interested in this kind of container may look at the <a href="entry:7">Heterogenous Generic Type</a>, which deals exactly with this issue.
</p>

<h2>Bounded Generics</h2>

<p>
So far we saw that generic methods usually infer implicitly the type to use based on the code, but we can also state it explicitly to constrain the compiler to accept only a given type of value.
Similarly, a generic type can be instantiated by specifying which type to be used at instantiation time, which is then checked upon the call of each method of the instance.
However, rather than accepting any type of object, and constrain it only when upon instantiation or method call, we might prefer to assume some constraints from the start to ensure that we receive instances which support some features, like the following method:
</p>
<pre><code>
public class Checker {
	public &lt;T extends Number> T check(T value, T defaultValue) {
		...
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The code remains exactly the same, but calling the method with <code>String</code> instances will be invalid, while calls with <code>Integer</code> or <code>Float</code> instances will be valid.
By bounding the generics to a specific type, it is then guaranteed that some methods will be available, like here <code>Number</code> implies to have access to the method <code>intValue()</code>.
This means that the <code>T</code> instances can exploit these methods, for instance <code>value.intValue() + defaultValue.intValue()</code>.
Bounding generics thus act as a way to ensure that the designed code is designed for specific uses, while a generic code should try to limit the bounding as much as possible, remove it in the best case.
</p>

<p>
Although the keyword is <code>extends</code>, it does not apply only to classes which <em>extend</em> other classes, or interfaces which <em>extend</em> other interfaces, but also to classes which <em>implement</em> interfaces.
It is also possible to bound the generics to several classes or interfaces, like <code>&lt;T extends Serializable &amp; Cloneable &amp; Comparable&lt;T>></code>, which means that <code>T</code> should extend or implement <em>all</em> the classes or interfaces listed.
Because Java cannot extend more than one class, only one class can be used to bound a generics and it should be listed first, while any number of interfaces can be added.
Notice the <code>Comparable&lt;T></code>, which uses the generics it is bounding: generics can be used to bound other generics as well as themselves.
</p>

<h2>Wildcard <code>?</code></h2>

<p>
Although generics provide a useful way to constrain the type of a variable in various ways, some constraints are not worth the introduction of a generics.
For example:
</p>
<pre><code>
public &lt;T> void print(List&lt;T> list) {
	for (T item : list) {
		System.out.println(item);
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
This method allows to print the items contained in the list on the console, but no concrete use is made of <code>T</code>: any instance can be used in this way, thus leading to wonder whether it is worth to specify it in the first place.
A usual mistake would be to think that, because we use the items as <code>Object</code> instances, we might as well replace <code>T</code> by <code>Object</code>, but it enforces <code>list</code> to be a <code>List&lt;Object></code>, thus forbiding to use this method on a <code>List&lt;Integer></code> for example.
This is because there is no inheritance link between a <code>List&lt;Object></code> and a <code>List&lt;Integer></code> (see <a href="#mix_class_and_generics_inheritance">here</a> for an explanation).
In this case, we don't want to constrain the <code>List</code> to be on a specific type of items, we explicitly want it to be on <em>any</em> type of item, which is achieved by using the wildcard <code>?</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>
public void print(List&lt;?> list) {
	for (Object item : list) {
		System.out.println(item);
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
We can see that the items are considered as <code>Object</code> instances anyway, but the list is not constrained anymore and can accept <code>List&lt;Object></code> as well as <code>List&lt;Integer></code> lists.
Only the items will be considered with the most generic type possible, which is <code>Object</code> here because the wildcard is unbounded.
It is possible to bound the wildcard in the same way than generics with <code>extends</code>, such that <code>List&lt;? extends Number></code> will accept any <code>List&lt;Integer></code> or <code>List&lt;Float></code> but reject <code>List&lt;String></code>.
The items are, consequently, considered as <code>Number</code>, and methods provided by this class can be used.
</p>

<p>
Although it happens far less frequently, it is also possible to say that a wildcard should accept any type <em>parent</em> of <code>Number</code> by replacing <code>extends</code> by <code>super</code>.
While <code>extends</code> usually applies to parameters used as <em>inputs</em>, like the list we read in the previous example, <code>super</code> usually applies to parameters used as <em>outputs</em>, like the example below:
</p>
<pre><code>
public void print(List&lt;? super Number> list) {
	list.add(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Indeed, we say here that we want a list able to accept any <code>Number</code> instances, which can be achieved by a <code>List&lt;Number></code> or a <code>List&lt;Object></code>, but not by a <code>List&lt;Integer></code> (a <code>Float</code> is not accepted despite being also a <code>Number</code>).
Because this constraint means that the list can accept <em>at least</em> <code>Number</code> instances, it could contain anything else too, and thus calling <code>list.get(index)</code> returns an instance recognised as an <code>Object</code>, not a <code>Number</code>.
If one want to have both a lower and an upper bound to the wildcard, one should prefer to use generics, as shown <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/29451739/2031083">here</a>, because Java does not allow to use <code>super</code> and <code>extends</code> together.
<!-- TODO Is it a technical limitation or is it justified? -->
Other limitations can occur, like the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/capture.html">wildcard capture</a> errors, but the interested reader can dig in the linked material for more information.
Interested people can also consider <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/wildcardGuidelines.html">these guidelines</a> to figure out how to use wildcards in there code.

<p>
Because <code>String</code> extends <code>Object</code>, a <code>String</code> can be considered as an <code>Object</code>, which means that we can store a <code>String</code> in a variable of type <code>Object</code>.
Similarly, <code>ArrayList&lt;String></code> extends <code>List&lt;String></code>, so we can also store an <code>ArrayList&lt;String></code> into a variable of type <code>List&lt;String></code>.
However, a common mistake is to think that one can store an <code>ArrayList&lt;String></code> into a variable of type <code>ArrayList&lt;Object></code>, because <code>String</code> extends <code>Object</code>, but this is wrong.
Those familiar with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/erasure.html">type erasure</a> might think about it as a technical limitation of the Java language, but there is actually a fundamental reason to forbid it.
</p>

<p>
This mistake occurs because of the ambiguous interpretation of the relationship between parents and children classes, which is usually called a <q>is a</q> relationship, one of the most ambiguous because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-a">the many interpretations it can cover</a>.
Indeed, it is hard to consider any of the three sentences below wrong:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a <code>String</code> is an <code>Object</code>,</li>
<li>an <code>ArrayList</code> of <code>String</code> instances is a <code>List</code> of <code>String</code> instances,</li>
<li>an <code>ArrayList</code> of <code>String</code> instances is an <code>ArrayList</code> of <code>Object</code> instances.</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, the fact is that parent and children classes are related through a specific kind of <q>is a</q> relationship: the extension relationship, which ensures that any use of the parent is also possible with the child class, because the child only <em>extends</em> the capabilities of the parent, it does not <em>alter</em> it (unless it breaks the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle">open/closed principle</a> with a bad design).
Indeed, <code>String</code> extends <code>Object</code> in the sense that every methods provided by <code>Object</code> can be used exactly in the same way with a <code>String</code> instance.
Similarly, all the methods of a <code>List&lt;String></code> can be used exactly in the same way on an <code>ArrayList&lt;String></code> instance.
However, although one can add any <code>Object</code> to an <code>ArrayList&lt;Object></code>, it is not possible with an <code>ArrayList&lt;String></code>, which accepts only <code>String</code> instances.
This is a fundamental difference: <code>ArrayList&lt;String></code> does not <em>extend</em> <code>ArrayList&lt;Object></code> (indeed they are both the same <code>ArrayList</code> class), it only accepts a smaller range of instances.
In other words, one could say that it is not the class <code>ArrayList&lt;String></code> which extends <em>the class</em> <code>ArrayList&lt;Object></code>, but the class <code>ArrayList&lt;Object></code> which extends <em>the range</em> of <code>ArrayList&lt;String></code>.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
This post covers all the fundamental aspects of generics that we can reuse in advanced techniques to produce generic programs.
We omitted some aspects, like the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/erasure.html">type erasure</a>, which are more about technical details to deal with during debugging.
