<h1>Agile Refactoring:<br>Conditional Split &amp; Join</h1>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>
	As per the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.9.2">Java 8 specification</a>, an <code>if-then-else</code> statement allows to choose between two branches of execution.
	The condition of the <code>if</code> statement provides the decision criteria between executing the <code>if</code> block (when the condition is satisfied) or the <code>else</code> block (when it is not).
	This structure with two branches can be split into two separate blocks, giving the ability to move them around independently, and joining them elsewhere if permitted.
</p>

<h2 id="Action">Conditional split &amp; join</h2>

<p>
	A conditional split/join can be applied in two situations.
	Either the instructions to separate are part of the same block (<code>if</code> conditional) or in a separate block (<code>if-else</code> conditional).
	However, the condition of the conditional <em>must not be impacted</em> by the instructions inside the conditional.
	A good habit is to extract the condition result into a variable<span class="warning">link to article</span>.
	By using the variable as the condition, we keep a value that will not change upon executing the instructions.
</p>

<h3 id="Action-if">Instructions in the same <code>if</code> block</h2>

<p>
	In this case, we consider a single <code>if</code> block:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (condition) {
  // code A
  // code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	A conditional split consists in separating the instructions into several blocks.
	This can be achieved by distributing the last (or first) instructions into an equivalent conditional after (or before) the initial conditional.
</p>
<pre><code>
if (condition) {
  // code A
}
if (condition) {
  // code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	Such a split allows to move both blocks around<span class="warning">link to article</span> independently (as long as such moves are allowed).
	For example, we can move the second block up:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (condition) {
  // code B
}
if (condition) {
  // code A
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	A conditional join consists in the reverse operation.
	Two consecutive <code>if</code> blocks with the same condition are merged into a single <code>if</code> conditional.
	If we take the last code above, we can join them as is:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (condition) {
  // code B
  // code A
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	This particular example can be achieved more directly with an instructions inversion<span class="warning">link to article</span> directly in the block.
	However, when the conditional structure becomes more complex, it might be interesting to split and join the conditional <entry id="./7">and the conditions</entry>.
	It breaks the whole structure into smaller pieces that can be moved around<span class="warning">link to article</span> and recomposed into a more intuitive construction.
</p>

<h3 id="Action-ifelse">Instructions separated in <code>if-else</code> blocks</h2>

<p>
	In this case, we consider some instructions in a <code>if</code> block and others in the <code>else</code> block:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (condition) {
  // code A
} else {
  // code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	A conditional split consists in separating the two blocks of the conditional.
	This can be achieved by transforming the <code>else</code> block into a separate <code>if</code> block.
	The condition of this new <code>if</code> block is the negation of <code>condition</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (condition) {
  // code A
}
if (!condition) { // Replace "else" by "if" with the opposite condition
  // code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	Such a split allows to move both blocks around<span class="warning">link to article</span> independently (as long as such moves are allowed).
	For example, we can move the second block up:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (!condition) {
  // code B
}
if (condition) {
  // code A
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	A conditional join consists in the reverse operation.
	Two consecutive <code>if</code> blocks <em>with complementary conditions</em> are merged into a single <code>if-else</code> conditional.
	If we take the last code above, we can join them as is:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (!condition) {
  // code B
} else { // Replace "if" with the opposite condition by "else"
  // code A
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	This particular example can be achieved more directly with a <entry id="./10">conditional inversion</entry>.
	However, when the conditional structure becomes more complex, it might be interesting to split and join the conditional <entry id="./7">and the conditions</entry>.
	It breaks the whole structure into smaller pieces that can be moved around<span class="warning">link to article</span> and recomposed into a more intuitive construction.
</p>

<h2 id="iso-proof">Isofunctionality</h2>

<p>
	We build here on the basic definition of the conditional.
	Splitting or joining the elements is just a different way to express the same thing.
	The main difference is to check again <code>condition</code> in between, which is "useless" because the value didn't change.
	But let's see in details how it is achieved for each case.
</p>

<h3 id="iso-proof-if">Instructions in the same <code>if</code> block</h2>

<p>
	When having a single block, we express that both instructions must be executed when <code>condition</code> holds.
	Upon splitting it in two blocks, we separately express that each instruction must be executed when <code>condition</code> holds.
	The only difference is that we check again <code>condition</code> before to execute the second instruction.
	But since we required <code>condition</code> to not be impacted by the instructions (especially not the first one), it means it is still the same boolean value.
	So it will trigger if and only if the first block triggered, leading to the same instructions being executed than in the single block version.
	So both the split and joined versions are equivalent.
</p>

<h3 id="iso-proof-ifelse">Instructions separated in <code>if-else</code> blocks</h2>

<p>
	When having an <code>if-else</code> conditional, we express that exactly one of the instructions must be executed depending on <code>condition</code>.
	Upon splitting it in two <code>if</code> conditionals, we separately express that each instruction must be executed depending on <code>condition</code>.
	The only difference is that we check again <code>condition</code> before to execute the second instruction.
	But since we required <code>condition</code> to not be impacted by the instructions (especially not the first one), it means it is still the same boolean value.
	So it will not trigger if the first conditional triggered (and vice-cersa), leading to the same instructions being executed than in the single conditional version.
	So both the split and joined versions are equivalent.
