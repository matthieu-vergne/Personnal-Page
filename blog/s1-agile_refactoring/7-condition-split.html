<h1>Agile Refactoring<br>Condition Split &amp; Join</h1>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>
	As per the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.9.2">Java 8 specification</a>, an <code>if-then-else</code> statement allows to choose between two branches of execution.
	The condition of the <code>if</code> statement provides the decision criteria between executing the <code>if</code> block (when the condition is satisfied) or the <code>else</code> block (when it is not).
	This condition can be composed, especially with an <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.23"><em>and</em> operator</a> or an <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.24"><em>or</em> operator</a>
	It is then possible to split this condition, distributing the code into several conditionals than can be moved around.
	They can be joined as well, giving the ability to organize the conditionals in various ways.
</p>

<h2 id="Action">Condition split &amp; join</h2>

<p class="warning">TODO</p>
<p class="warning">TODO Focus on if-else, to reach that state you may need: explicit else + replace else statement by block (link to articles)</p>
<p class="warning">TODO Useful for moving blocks around, especially combined with: conditional decomposition (link to article)</p>

<h3 id="Action-disjunction">Disjunction (<code>||</code>, <em>or</em> operator)</h3>

<p>
	Here is a disjunction, an <em>or</em> conditional between two booleans <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (c1 || c2) {
	// code A
} else {
	// code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	Literally, the condition means that if one of the two booleans is <code>true</code>, then <code>code A</code> is executed, otherwise it is <code>code B</code>.
	We can also read it like this: if the first boolean is <code>true</code> we execute <code>code A</code>, if the second boolean is <code>true</code> we also execute <code>code A</code>, otherwise we execute <code>code B</code>.
	This second reading is the recipe to follow in order to change the code: split the disjunction by having <code>code A</code> executed in two separated blocks, with the first boolean then with the second boolean:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (c1) {
	// code A
} else if (c2) {
	// code A
} else {
	// code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	The join is just the reverse operation: if you have the two first blocks with the same code, here <code>code A</code>, then factor them into a single block, the factored condition being a disjunction of the two initial conditions.
	They must be the two <em>first</em> blocks, and have the exact same code, for them to be joined.
</p>

<h3 id="Action-conjunction">Conjunction (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <em>and</em> operator)</h3>

<p>
	The conjunction case is quite different, but the split remain simple.
	Let's tart with this code:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (c1 &amp;&amp; c2) {
	// code A
} else {
	// code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	To split the condition, you can first copy the whole conditional and replace only the content of the first block by the copy:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (c1 &amp;&amp; c2) {
	if (c1 &amp;&amp; c2) {         //
		// code A           // Copy of the full
	} else {                // conditional into
		// code B           // its first block.
	}                       //
} else {
	// code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	Then, just reduce the first condition to the first boolean, and the second condition to the second boolean:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (c1) {     // Remove c2 here
	if (c2) { // Remove c1 here
		// code A
	} else {
		// code B
	}
} else {
	// code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	To join the code into a conjunction, the process is more involved, since you need to find the same structure as above in order to join it.
	But once it is done, just prepend the internal condition with the external one through a conjunction:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (c1) {
	if (c1 &amp;&amp; c2) { // Add c1 here in first position
		// code A
	} else {
		// code B
	}
} else {
	// code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	Then remove completely the external conditional to keep only the interal one:
</p>
<pre><code>
// Keep only the content of the first block
if (c1 &amp;&amp; c2) {
	// code A
} else {
	// code B
}
// Remove the rest
</code></pre>

<h2 id="iso-proof">Isofunctionality</h2>

<p class="warning">TODO</p>

<h3 id="iso-proof-disjunction">Disjunction (<code>||</code>, <em>or</em> operator)</h3>

<p>
	The isofunctionality of the disjunction split/join is rather easy to demonstrate.
	So let's start with this one.
</p>
<pre><code>
if (c1 || c2) {
	// code A
} else {
	// code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	If you create the truth table of this code, then the execution of <code>A</code> follows the common <em>or</em> operator, since it is controlled by the <em>or</em> condition.
	Thus, it is always executed unless both booleans are <code>false</code>.
	Meanwhile, the execution of <code>B</code> is the complementary (or negation) of the execution of <code>A</code>, since the two blocks of a conditional are exclusive.
	Thus, it is only executed when both booleans are <code>false</code>.
	Which gives us this truth table:
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th><code>c1</code></th>
		<th><code>c2</code></th>
		<th></th>
		<th><code>A</code></th>
		<th><code>B</code></th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>0</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	Now let's look at the code with the split condition:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (c1) {
	// code A
} else if (c2) {
	// code A
} else {
	// code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	If the first boolean is false, then the first block with <code>A</code> is not executed, and the second condition is evaluated.
	If the second boolean is false, then this second block with <code>A</code> is also not executed, leading to execute the <code>else</code> clause with <code>B</code> instead.
	This is exactly the first line of the previous truth table.
	If we repeat the reasoning for each row of the table, we always obtain the same result.
	In other words, both versions lead to the same execution steps, so if the program is at a given state \(S\) before the conditional, it will result in the same state \(S'\) after the conditional, whether the code is split or joined, thus they are isofunctional.
</p>

<h3 id="iso-proof-conjunction">Conjunction (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <em>and</em> operator)</h3>

<p>
	Let's focus on the conjunction now:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (c1 &amp;&amp; c2) {
	// code A
} else {
	// code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	We can use a truth table to demonstrate the conjunction, like for the disjunction.
	Instead of an <em>or</em> table for <code>A</code>, we get an <em>and</em> table, and <code>B</code> remains the negation of <code>A</code>.
	However, it is interesting to see that each step of the change is actually isofunctional too.
	Let's tart with the internal copy:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (c1 &amp;&amp; c2) {
	if (c1 &amp;&amp; c2) {         //
		// code A           // Copy of the full
	} else {                // conditional into
		// code B           // its first block.
	}                       //
} else {
	// code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	By copying the whole conditional into its first block, we make the first block more complex.
	However, since it is in the first block, the internal conditional can only be executed when the external condition passes.
	But then, the internal condition passes too, since it is the very same, so the internal <code>else</code> block is never executed.
	Since only <code>code A</code> is executed when the conjunction passes, and only <code>code B</code> is executed otherwise, it is still isofunctional with the original code.
</p>
<p>
	Now let's go to the next step:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (c1) {     // Remove c2 here
	if (c2) { // Remove c1 here
		// code A
	} else {
		// code B
	}
} else {
	// code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	Here, the only way to execute <code>code A</code> is to have both booleans at <code>true</code>, since we need to make both conditions pass.
	All the other blocks are filled with <code>code B</code>, so when any of the two booleans is <code>false</code>, only <code>code B</code> is executed.
	You may use a truth table to convince yourself if required.
	Then again, it is the exact same thing than with the original code, thus it is still isofunctional.
	Now the condition si split, thus demonstrating the split is isofunctional.
</p>
<p>
	As for the join, let's check what happens when we prepend the internal condition:
</p>
<pre><code>
if (c1) {
	if (c1 &amp;&amp; c2) { // Add c1 here in first position
		// code A
	} else {
		// code B
	}
} else {
	// code B
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	In a similar way than before, the internal condition is evaluated only when the external one passes, so at that time <code>c1</code> is known to be <code>true</code>.
	Since the internal conditiona is a conjunction, having the first operand always <code>true</code> meand that the evaluation always depend on the second operand, thus <code>c2</code>.
	In other words, bringing <code>c1</code> into the internal condition changes nothing because we still need to do the same evaluation of <code>c2</code>.
	Thus, we are isofunctional with the split condition that precedes this change.
</p>
<p>
	Then, by removing the external condition, we just retrieve the original code with a joined condition:
</p>
<pre><code>
// Keep only the content of the first block
if (c1 &amp;&amp; c2) {
	// code A
} else {
	// code B
}
// Remove the rest
</code></pre>
<p>
	This is by definition isofunctional with the initial joined condition, since it <em>is</em> the joined condition itself, and thus isofunctional with the split condition as well.
</p>

<p class="warning">TODO Can be achieved with: invert conditional + split disjunction + else statement to block + invert external conditional + invert internal conditional</p>
