<h1>Agile Refactoring:<br>Variable Renaming</h1>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>
	As per the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.4">Java 8 specification</a>, a local variable declaration statement comes with various things, including a variable declarator list.
	Each variable declarator comes with a variable declarator ID and, optionally, its initializer.
	Focusing on the variable declarator ID, it is composed of an identifier and, for arrays, one or more dimensions (the <code>[]</code> stuff).
	The specifications for a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.3">field declaration</a>, a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.1">method parameter</a>, and a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.8.1">constructor parameter</a> differ, but they all converge towards the same identifier definition.
	All of them share the same purpose (storing some values for reuse), so despite speaking about "variable renaming" because it is the most frequent case, we also cover the fields and parameters.
	<span class="warning">TODO Consider how <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.12.3">the term "variable" is used in the specs</a>.</span>
	We don't say "identifier renaming" because they also participate in method and class naming, which are different beasts.
	<span class="warning">TODO Link to method renaming.</span>
	<span class="warning">TODO Link to class renaming.</span>
</p>
<p>
	Variable (or field or parameter) renaming is all about this identifier, which has <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.8">its own specifications</a>.
	It packs a few restrictions, but overall it is an all you want buffet: an unlimited-length sequence of unicode letters and digits.
	This flexibility offers the capacity to name stuff to better represent the business concepts we implement, but also to use various naming strategies to better differentiate the numerous pieces of data we deal with.
</p>

<h2 id="Action">Renaming a variable/field/parameter</h2>

<h3 id="Action-method">Overall process</h3>

<p>
	Usually, people use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to code, which comes with various features to help change the code faster.
	Variable renaming is typically one of them, and it allows to figure out all the places where this variable is used and replace all of them at once.
	It is really useful and, given how frequently we can use it, it is strongly advised to master the shortcut that your IDE (or yourself) assign to it.
	After all, naming stuff is hard, so better have it easy for renaming.
</p>
<p>
	However, you might have cases where you can't use that renaming feature.
	For example when you use a simple notepad (yes, a blind, massive search and replace is a bad idea), or when the variable is public and used in external projects that you don't want to break, etc.
	In such a case, here are the different phases to go through:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Create the new variable from the old one:
		<pre><code>
		int oldVar = 123;
		<mark>int newVar = oldVar;</mark>
		</code></pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		Align the new variable to the old one:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Before reading the old one, update the new one with it:
				<pre><code>
				<mark>newVar = oldVar;</mark>
				double result = oldVar * multiplier;
				</code></pre>
			</li>
			<li>
				After writing the old one, update the new one with it:
				<pre><code>
				oldVar = computeSomething();
				<mark>newVar = oldVar;</mark>
				</code></pre>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Replace the reads of the old one by the new one, keeping the alignment before that allows this replacement:
		<pre><code>
		newVar = oldVar;
		double result = oldVar * multiplier;
		<hr/>
		newVar = oldVar; <mark>// don't touch this</mark>
		double result = <mark>newVar</mark> * multiplier;
		</code></pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		Replace the writes of the old one by the new one, reversing the following alignment to keep the old one aligned:
		<pre><code>
		oldVar = computeSomething();
		newVar = oldVar;
		<hr/>
		<mark>newVar</mark> = computeSomething();
		<mark>oldVar = newVar</mark>;
		</code></pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		Get rid of the alignments for reads:
		<pre><code>
		newVar = oldVar;
		double result = newVar * multiplier;
		<hr/>
		double result = newVar * multiplier;
		</code></pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		Get rid of the alignments for writes:
		<pre><code>
		newVar = computeSomething();
		oldVar = newVar;
		<hr/>
		newVar = computeSomething();
		</code></pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		Get rid of the old variable:
		<pre><code>
		int oldVar = 123;
		int newVar = oldVar;
		<hr/>
		int newVar = <mark>123</mark>;
		</code></pre>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	There might have a few differences between local variables, parameters, and fields, but they all follow these phases.
	For a parameter, you create a new local variable in phase 1 to not break the method or constructor signature with a new parameter, and discard it in phase 7 while renaming the old parameter.
	For a field used in other projects, the old field remains usable until the end of phase 4, and you may start phase 5 only when you consider that other projects depending on you have done their own refactoring.
	Deprecating the old field with documentation is a good way to inform your dependers of the required actions they need to take (phases 2-6) to remain compatible with a future version where the old variable will be removed.
	Just don't do it before you finishes phase 2, because the new field is not aligned yet with the old one before that.
	The most time consuming phases, when a lot of code is involved, are phases 2-6 that depend on the number of read/writes present in the code, so you should plan carefully your changes when others depend on you.
</p>

<h3 id="Action-example">Overall example</h3>

<p>
	Here is a full example of code to illustrate all these phases:
</p>
<pre><code>
double computePrice(double a) {
	a = a * 2; // quantity
	a = a * 1.2; // tax
	return a; // total
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	Phase 1: Create the new variable from the old one.
	It is a trivial action to do in a single step.
</p>
<pre><code>
double computePrice(double a) {
	<mark>double price = a;</mark>
	a = a * 2; // quantity
	a = a * 1.2; // tax
	return a; // total
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	Phase 2: Align the new variable to the old one.
	Each alignment is a separate step in this phase: you can add them in any order and at any time, no need to add all of them at once, the code still works.
</p>
<pre><code>
double computePrice(double a) {
	double price = a;
	<mark>price = a; // align before read</mark>
	a = a * 2; // quantity
	<mark>price = a; // align after write</mark>
	<mark>price = a; // align before read</mark>
	a = a * 1.2; // tax
	<mark>price = a; // align after write</mark>
	<mark>price = a; // align before read</mark>
	return a; // total
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	Phase 3: Replace the reads of the old one by the new one, keeping the alignment before that allows this replacement.
	Again, each change is a separate step to be done at your own pace.
</p>
<pre><code>
double computePrice(double a) {
	double price = a;
	price = a; // align before read
	a = <mark>price</mark> * 2; // quantity
	price = a; // align after write
	price = a; // align before read
	a = <mark>price</mark> * 1.2; // tax
	price = a; // align after write
	price = a; // align before read
	return <mark>price</mark>; // total
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	Phase 4: Replace the writes of the old one by the new one, reversing the following alignment to keep the old one aligned.
	A replace+reverse pair (e.g. lines 4+5) must be done at once, but each pair can be done separately.
</p>
<pre><code>
double computePrice(double a) {
	double price = a;
	price = a; // align before read
	<mark>price</mark> = price * 2; // quantity
	<mark>a = price</mark>; // align after write
	price = a; // align before read
	<mark>price</mark> = price * 1.2; // tax
	<mark>a = price</mark>; // align after write
	price = a; // align before read
	return price; // total
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	Phase 5: Get rid of the alignments for reads.
	Again, each removal is independent.
</p>
<pre><code>
double computePrice(double a) {
	double price = a;
	price = price * 2; // quantity
	a = price; // align after write
	price = price * 1.2; // tax
	a = price; // align after write
	return price; // total
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	Phase 6: Get rid of the alignments for writes.
	Same thing, each removal is independent.
</p>
<pre><code>
double computePrice(double a) {
	double price = a;
	price = price * 2; // quantity
	price = price * 1.2; // tax
	return price; // total
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	Phase 7: Get rid of the old variable.
	To be done in a single atomic step.
</p>
<pre><code>
	double computePrice(double <mark>price</mark>) {
		<mark>// No more local variable</mark>
		price = price * 2; // quantity
		price = price * 1.2; // tax
		return price; // total
	}
</code></pre>
<p>
	At this point, you can compare to the first version of the code to see that the only change is the parameter renaming from <code>a</code> to <code>price</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="iso-proof">Isofunctionality</h2>

<p>
	It is usually quite obvious that renaming a variable/parameter/field is isofunctional.
	Either you mistakenly use a name that is already used and you mess up everything, but the compiler itself rejects it because it is declared twice, either you use a unique name and it works.
	After all, identifiers only allow to point to a memory location where to read/write data, and naming it differently changes nothing regarding how we use it.
	What is more interesting is to show that each manual phase is also isofunctional.
</p>
<p>
	Phase 1 creates a new variable (local variable, parameter, or field).
	We store in it the initial value of the old variable, but we don't use it for anything.
	In particular, we don't use it to change the behaviour of the program.
	In short, it is isofunctional by definition.
</p>
<p>
	Phase 2 add alignment instructions to update the value of the new variable with the current value of the old one.
	Again, all we do is change the value stored for the new variable, but we still never use it for anything.
	So it is again isofunctional by definition.
	However, after this phase is over (and only after it is over), we also know that all the instructions (at least those in our control) that involve the old variable are directly surrounded by these alignments.
	In other words, just <em>before</em> and just <em>after</em> such an instruction is executed, we know that the state of the new variable is the same than the state of the old variable.
	That will be useful later.
</p>
<p>
	Phase 3 replaces the reads of the old variable, meaning that we are in one of these instructions involving the old variable.
	As mentionned above, just before to execute it, we know that the old and new variable are in the same state.
	So by replacing the old variable by the new one, we know that we consume the same value.
	As such, the instruction remains the same, and with the same inputs, so the output also remain the same.
	The direct consequence of it is having the same behavkiour than before, thus being isofunctional.
</p>
<p>
	Phase 4 is a bit tricky, because it includes 2 changes at a time.
	But what we should look at is the state of the programm before and after the 2 instructions involved: the variable computation and the alignment post-write.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Before the change, the computed result is stored in the old variable, and the following alignment stores the old variable value in the new variable.
		In this case:
		<ol>
			<li>before the computation we know that both the old and new variable are in the same state S1 ;</li>
			<li>after computing the value and updating the old variable, the old variable is in a new state S2 while the new variable is still in S1 ;</li>
			<li>after aligning, the new variable reaches the same state than the old variable, meaning both are in state S2.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		After the change, the computed result is stored in the <em>new</em> variable, and the following alignment stores the <em>new</em> variable value in the <em>old</em> variable.
		In this case:
		<ol>
			<li>before the computation we know that both the old and new variable are in the same state S1 ;</li>
			<li>after computing the value and updating the <em>new</em> variable, the <em>new</em> variable is in a new state S2 while the <em>old</em> variable is still in S1 ;</li>
			<li>after aligning, the <em>old</em> variable reaches the same state than the <em>new</em> variable, meaning both are in state S2.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	As we can see, before and after the change, although the intermediate states change, they still both start and end in the same way: both variables start at state S1, and both variables end at state S2.
	Since both versions of the code, by starting at the same initial state of the program, lead to the same final state of the program, they are equivalent, and thus isofunctional.
</p>
<p>
	So far, phases 1 to 4 are shown to be isofunctional.
	And as mentionned before, they act on the code under our control.
	If we include any code out of our control, like code in another project using the old variable (especially fields), it does not change that isofunctionality.
	Indeed, all our instructions are surrounded by these alignments that ensure that (i) we never compute anything before to ensure that both variables are in the same state, and (ii) we never go ahead without ensuring they are still in the same state.
	If we remove an alignment pre-computation (for reads), an external code may have changed the state of the old variable, making it different to the new variable.
	The computation would then give a different result between the old variable and the new one, thus breaking isofunctionality.
	At the opposite, by removing the alignment post-computation (for writes), the old variable would not be updated, thus providing an obsolete value to the external code using it later, breaking isofunctionality too.
	This is why the next phase 5, which removes these alignments, cannot be started until the external users have also finished phase 4.
</p>
<p>
	After phase 4 is done (internally and externally), we always have this pattern occurring in the code:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Some computation is done (internally or externally), updating the new variable</li>
	<li>The old variable is aligned on the new variable</li>
	<li>Some independent code might be executed</li>
	<li>The new variable is aligned on the old one</li>
	<li>Some computation is done (internally or externally) reading the new variable</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Since the new and old variables are already aligned at point 2 (write alignment), point 4 (read alignment) is redundant and can be removed.
	Even if you look at the very first read alignment, which may succeeds the declaration which acts as a write alignment in addition to the variable declaration.
	This is why phase 5, which removes the read alignments, is isofunctional: they are now all preceded by write alignments that make them redundant, so we can remove them in any order without impacting the program.
</p>
<p>
	Then, since the old variable is not read anymore, not even for aligning (point 4 is gone), giving it a value on point 2 is also devoid of relevant effect on the program, so we can get rid of point 2.
	This is why phase 6, which removes the write alignments, is isofunctional: we only write in the old variable, never read it, so we can remove these writes in any order without impacting the program.
</p>
<p>
	For external users, since we have reached phase 4 before them, they can safely reach phase 4 after us.
	But then, from their point of view, phase 4 is reached exhaustively, so they can go ahead with phase 5 and 6, since they are isofunctional.
	In other words, the external user can go through all the refactoring at once.
	If there is a chain of depencdencies, the idea is to reach phase 4 incrementally in the chain, until the end of the chain is reached.
	The end passes through all the phases at once, then the chain is navigated in reverse to apply the phases 5 and above incrementally.
	This way, when we internally decide to stop at phase 4, we only need to care about the length of that chain, then assum that upon coming back to us, everything has been refactored on our dependers.
	That gives us the ability to go through all the remaining phases, until the old variable is completely removed, without breaking the code of our depdenders.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, phase 7 occurs when the old variable is not used anywhere anymore, only created to initialize the new variable.
	At that point, all we do is remove the intermediary step of passing through the old variable first.
	Nothing changes in terms of behaviours, so this final phase is also isofunctional.
