<a href="#OlsonRoeseZanna1996">Olson et al.</a> mention that at least two kinds of expectancies have been considered in the literature.
One is <em>normative expectancies</em>, which are about what <em>should</em> happen in the future<!-- TODO example -->.
Another is <em>probabilistic expectancies</em>, which are about what <em>might</em> happen in the future and, thus, will be our main focus here.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#OlsonRoeseZanna1996">Olson et al.</a>:
<q>
Expectancies are beliefs about a future state of affairs. They are subjective probabilities linking the future with an outcome at some level of probability ranging from merely possible to virtually certain.
</q>
Expectancy is a <em>belief</em> about an <em>outcome</em> assumed to occur <em>in the future</em> with a given <em>probability</em>.
Expectancy is future-focused: one does not expect about past outcomes.
Regarding outcomes we believe to have occurred in the past, we may see them as expectancies about future information to come, like: I believe that Jane went to the cinema yesterday (past event, not expectancy), so I expect her to confirm/speak about it when she comes back tomorrow (future event, expectancy).
<!-- TODO Is it relevant to do the distinction between beliefs about past and future events? -->
<q>The central mechanism is motivation in its simplest form: the basic tendency to approach pleasant things and to avoid noxious things.</q>
Expectancy acts as a trigger.
<q>The relation of expectancies to performance received initial attention in the context of <q>level of aspiration,</q> which refers to desired levels of future performance (Lewin, Dembo, Festinger, &amp; Sears, 1944).</q>
Not only expectancies can be used to evaluate errors when performing to identify improvements to do, but it can also be used to evaluate error about performance level itself for regulating efforts, in particular to act as a trigger to improve (or stop if we expect higher performance to be useless).
<!-- TODO Interesting sources to consider may be (Rotter, 1954) about social learning theory, and (Tolman, 1932) expectancy model of reinforcement learning. (Edwards, 1954) can be of interest too. -->
<!-- TODO Related to expectancy, although different because more goal-focused, is the notion of set used by (Jones and Thibaut, 1958) and (Zajonc, 1960) -->
Expectancy can be <em>explicit</em>, the outcome being consciously expected and the expectancy potentially stated, or <em>implicit</em>, generating the same state of surprise when contradicted by observation but without preparation.
