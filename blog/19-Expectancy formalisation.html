<a href="#OlsonRoeseZanna1996">Olson et al.</a> mention that at least two kinds of expectancies have been considered in the literature of social psychology<!-- TODO At that time, to be updated -->.
One is <em>normative expectancies</em>, which are about what <em>should</em> happen in the future<!-- TODO example -->.
Another is <em>probabilistic expectancies</em>, which are about what <em>might</em> happen in the future and, thus, will be our main focus here.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#OlsonRoeseZanna1996">Olson et al.</a>:
<q>
Expectancies are beliefs about a future state of affairs. They are subjective probabilities linking the future with an outcome at some level of probability ranging from merely possible to virtually certain.
</q>
Expectancy is a <em>belief</em> about an <em>outcome</em> assumed to occur <em>in the future</em> with a given <em>probability</em>.
Expectancy is future-focused: one does not expect about past outcomes.
Regarding outcomes we believe to have occurred in the past, we may see them as expectancies about future information to come, like: I believe that Jane went to the cinema yesterday (past event, not expectancy), so I expect her to confirm/speak about it when she comes back tomorrow (future event, expectancy).
<!-- TODO Is it relevant to do the distinction between beliefs about past and future events? -->
<q>The central mechanism is motivation in its simplest form: the basic tendency to approach pleasant things and to avoid noxious things.</q>
Expectancy acts as a trigger.
<q>The relation of expectancies to performance received initial attention in the context of <q>level of aspiration,</q> which refers to desired levels of future performance (Lewin, Dembo, Festinger, &amp; Sears, 1944).</q>
Not only expectancies can be used to evaluate errors when performing to identify improvements to do, but it can also be used to evaluate error about performance level itself for regulating efforts, in particular to act as a trigger to improve (or stop if we expect higher performance to be useless).
<!-- TODO Interesting sources to consider may be (Rotter, 1954) about social learning theory, and (Tolman, 1932) expectancy model of reinforcement learning. (Edwards, 1954) can be of interest too. -->
<!-- TODO Related to expectancy, although different because more goal-focused, is the notion of set used by (Jones and Thibaut, 1958) and (Zajonc, 1960) -->
Expectancy can be <em>explicit</em>, the outcome being consciously expected and the expectancy potentially stated, or <em>implicit</em>, generating the same state of surprise when contradicted by observation but without preparation.
<!-- TODO -->
<q>All expectancies are derived from beliefs (i.e., our knowledge/schemas about the world)</q> and the authors provide some details about the types and sources of these beliefs.
In particular, beliefs may come from direct experience, be taught or shared by other people, or be inferred from other beliefs.
The authors discuss four properties of expectancies: its certainty, its accessibility, its explicitness, and its importance.
<em>Certainty</em> is <q>the subjective level of probability associated with the anticipated outcome/event</q>, from very uncertain to absolutely certain. We may also speak about confidence, which is <q>the range of possible likelihoods</q>, from large ranges for uncertain expectancies (no idea, it can be anything) to narrow ones for certain expectancies (the coin will for sure fall on head with 50% probability). Certainty is determined based on whether the agent directly experiences it, whether other agents reach a consensus about it, whether it has been (dis)confirmed in the past, and also depending on its accessibility (described below).
<em>Accessibility</em> is <q>the likelihood that the expectancy will be activated</q> and <q>predicts the likelihood that it will be used to interpret reality (Bruner, 1957; see Higgins, Chapter 5, thi volume).</q> An expectancy which comes to mind more frequently or rapidly is more accessible. Accessibility is determined by the frequency of its activators, their recency, their importance (described below), and how they are disconfirmed (the consequent surprise leading to making the agent aware of the disconfirmed expectancy it holds).
<em>Explicitness</em> is whether an expectancy is generated consciously (explicit) or inconsciously (implicit), <q>see Ditto &amp; Hilton's discussion of the characteristics of expectancies, 1990, p. 99</q>. Implicit expectancies have effects that can be considered as <q>examples of "automatic" processing (see Bargh, 1984; Uleman &amp; Bargh, 1989).</q> Explicitness can be due to the requirement of the expectancy for planning an event, to an explicit question about the expectancy, to the importance of the expectancy, and to their propensity to be disconfirmed.
<em>Importance</em> is the <q>motivational significance</q> of the expectancy, and is determined by the relevance to important needs and relation with other (important or numerous) expectancies.
Expectancies have many consequences, whether they are cognitive, affective, behavioral, or physiological. For the sake of our study, we will mainly focus on the cognitivie and behavioral ones, since affective and physiological consequences can be irrelevant for a machine.
On the cognitive aspect, <q>expectancies direct attention and thus influence what information gets encoded (see Higgins &amp; Bargh, 1987).</q> On one side, people <q>see what they expect to see</q> (see Rothbart, Evans, &amp; Fulero, 1979), but on the other <q>information that is inconsistent with expectancies also gets noticed (e.g., Hastie &amp; Kumar, 1979).</q> In other words, expectancies allow to spot quickly the pieces of information to revise while spending less time on already known ones. <q>Both consistent and inconsistent information will receive more processing than irrelevant information (Hashtroudi, Mutter, Cole, &amp; Green, 1984; Stern, Marrs, Millar, &amp; Cole, 1984).</q> This is an important aspect for an intelligent machine, since it allows to spot the required improvements to increase performance while ensuring that increasing experience comes with increasing efficiency.
