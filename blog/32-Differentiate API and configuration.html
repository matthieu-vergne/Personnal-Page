<h1>How to Design a (Generics-Free) Generic Interface?</h1>

<!-- TODO -->
<!-- Trap of top-down: imagine generic, fail to specialize properly -->
<!-- Counter-intuitive of bottom-up: start specific, generalize as needed -->
<!-- # In situ implementation -->
<!-- # Extract implementation to method -->
<!-- # Make method static to identify all inputs -->
<!-- # Extract method to object -->
<!-- # Make method non-static to access object state -->
<!-- # Extract method argument to constructor argument to exploit object state -->
<!-- Key question: if I change the implementation, should the argument change? Yes then implementation-specific, no then generic -->
<!-- # Extract interface from implementation -->
<!-- # Create other implementations with their own constructor parameters -->
<p>
Generics have been introduced in Java 5 to <cite>add stability to your code by making more of your bugs detectable at compile time</cite>, dixit the <a href="#OracleTutorial">Oracle tutorial</a>.
It is thus a great way to ensure that you are using the right type of object in your code even in cases where you don't know the exact type in advance.
</p>

<p>
In this article, we focus specifically on the most common situation: we need to use a class that defines one or more generics for itself.
Probably the most common use of generics comes with the standard Java data structures.
As Java developers, we often instantiate a <code>List&lt;E></code> or a <code>Map&lt;K, V></code>, which are both generic classes (classes relying on Generics).
As a matter of fact, which class to assign to each generics is rather straightforward.
If you need to create a list of <code>Coin</code> objects, then just create a <code>List&lt;Coin></code>.
If you need to map various <code>String</code> values to their own list of <code>Coin</code>, then create a <code>Map&lt;String, List&lt;Coin>></code>.
</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>
Maybe you already saw here and there these <code>extends</code> and <code>super</code> keywords.
For example, when you call <code>list.addAll(otherList)</code>, the <code>addAll</code> method does not simply take a list of the same type (<code>List&lt;E></code>).
And this is not the only one.
Here are some straightforward methods we can use on a <code>List</code> object since Java 8:
</p>

<pre><code>
public interface List&lt;E> extends Collection&lt;E> {
	// ...
	boolean addAll(Collection&lt;? extends E> c);
	boolean removeAll(Collection&lt;?> c);
	void replaceAll(UnaryOperator&lt;E> operator)
	void sort(Comparator&lt;? super E> c);
	// ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Using a <code>Comparator</code> for sorting is the usual deal, no surprise here.
Using a <code>UnaryOperator</code> to replace each value with another one is not strange either for those familiar with it.
Using a <code>Collection</code> instead of a <code>List</code> allows to consume a <code>Set</code>, which is sometimes useful.
But what about their Generics?
What are the <code>extends</code> and <code>super</code> keywords?
And why one is using the proper generics <code>E</code> while the other only uses <code>?</code>?
Should you also use them when you define your own method parameters?
</p>

<h2>A matter of reuse: genericness vs. constraints</h2>

<p>
The aim of Generics is to provide type controls at compilation time in cases where the type is not known in advance.
Since you don't know the type, the question is then: what can you at least assume about it?
The 4 generics definitions we saw previously allow to describe specific constraints on the Generics type.
The more constraints the Generics fulfills, the more you know about it, and so the more you can do with it.
But the more you constrain it, the less you can reuse your method elsewhere, because you can only use it where those constraints apply.
The goal is thus to constrain the Generics enough to do what you need, but not more to not reduce the reusability of your code.
</p>

<h3>No particular type constraint? Then anything goes with <code>?</code></h3>

<p>
Let's start with the least constrained case:
</p>
<pre><code>
boolean removeAll(Collection&lt;?> c);
</code></pre>
<p>
This <code>List</code> method accepts a <code>Collection</code> with any Generics.
It does not need to be of the same type than the Generics of the current <code>List</code>.
Indeed, when you call <code>list.remove(x)</code>, you can provide any kind of object (<code>remove</code> accepts any <code>Object</code>).
If it is an object of the wrong type, it will simply not be found in the list and thus won't be removed.
There is no reason to constrain it to be of the same type.
Similarly, when removing several objects, there is no reason to constrain their type either.
</p>

<p>
When you define your own methods, you may start by accepting any Generics by setting them with the wildcard <code>?</code>.
If you need something more specific at some point, your method will not compile.
Just add the relevant constraint at that time.
</p>

<h3>Extract some <code>E</code> from it? Then <code>? extends E</code></h3>

<p>
Let's see the most intuitive constraint that is <code>extends</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>
boolean addAll(Collection&lt;? extends E> c);
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>extends</code> keyword, as we are used to, means that the Generics type should extend <code>E</code>.
It works either with <code>E</code> itself or any of its child classes.
When adding elements to our <code>List</code>, we need to ensure they are of the right type <code>E</code>.
Thus, the elements that we extract from the provided <code>Collection</code> should be of type <code>E</code>.
Only then when can supply them to our <code>List</code>.
</p>

<p>
When you define your own methods, check what you extract from the generic class that you receive (what is returned by a method that you need from it).
If you need to <em>ext</em>ract a specific type of objects, then the corresponding Generics should <em>ext</em>end it.
It does not matter what you do with it: just look at what type of object you need to extract from the generic class.
Its Generics should extend this type to be compatible.
</p>
<pre><code>
interface GenericClass&lt;X> {
	X someCall();
}
&lt;T> void doSomething(GenericClass&lt;? extends T> arg) { // extends T
	T extracted = arg.someCall(); // because you need to extract T from it
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Supply some <code>E</code> to it? Then <code>? super E</code></h3>

<p>
Let's look then at <code>super</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>
void sort(Comparator&lt;? super E> c);
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>super</code> keywords is the "reverse" of <code>extends</code>.
The <code>Comparator</code> Generics should thus have a type which is <code>E</code> or a parent class, including <code>Object</code>.
Indeed, our <code>List</code> contains objects of type <code>E</code>, so we will supply <code>E</code> instances to the <code>Comparator</code>.
A <code>Comparator</code> that compares <code>E</code> instances works, but one that compares <code>Object</code> instances works too.
For example, here we supply 2 <code>E</code> instances to a <code>Comparator</code>.
But if it compares their <code>toString()</code> values, it can consume any object, not only <code>E</code> instances.
So a <code>Comparator&lt;Object></code>, which can compare any kind of object, can also compare <code>E</code> instances, so we should be able to use it for our <code>List&lt;E></code>.
</p>

<p>
When you define your own methods, check what you supply to the generic class that you receive (what argument you give to a method that you need from it).
If you need to <em>sup</em>ply a specific type of objects, then the corresponding Generics should <em>sup</em>er it.
It does not matter where it comes from: just look at what type of object you need to supply to the generic class.
Its Generics should super this type to be compatible.
</p>
<pre><code>
interface GenericClass&lt;X> {
	void someCall(X x);
}
&lt;T> void doSomething(T t, GenericClass&lt;? super T> arg) { // super T
	arg.someCall(t); // because you need to supply T to it
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Extract and supply <code>E</code>? Then go full <code>E</code></h3>

<p>
Now let's look at the last case:
</p>
<pre><code>
void replaceAll(UnaryOperator&lt;E> operator)
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>UnaryOperator</code> allows to replace a value by another: we give it the old value, it returns the new one.
Our <code>List</code> containes <code>E</code> instances, so we need to <em>supply</em> a <code>E</code> to the operator, so its Generics should <code>super E</code>.
But the returned values should be put back into our <code>List</code>, which accepts only <code>E</code> instances.
So we also need to <em>extract</em> a <code>E</code> from the operator, so its Generics should also <code>extends E</code>.
As a reminder, <code>super E</code> allows <code>E</code> or a parent class, and <code>extends E</code> allows <code>E</code> or a child class.
The only way to fulfill both constraints is to be exactly of type <code>E</code>.
This is why we need a <code>UnaryOperator&lt;E></code>.
</p>

<p>
When you define your own methods, check what you supply and extract to the generic class that you receive.
If for a specific Generics you need to extract a given type, extend it.
If for a specific Generics you need to supply a given type, super it.
If for the same Generics you need both, then apply both constraints by asking for the exact type.
</p>
<pre><code>
interface GenericClass&lt;X> {
	void someCall(X x);
	X someOtherCall();
}
&lt;T> void doSomething(T supplied, GenericClass&lt;T> arg) { // T alone (extends + super)
	arg.someCall(supplied);            // because you need to supply T to it
	T extracted = arg.someOtherCall(); // and to extract T from it
}
</code></pre>

<p>
If the constraints apply to different generics, then consider them separately:
</p>
<pre><code>
interface GenericClass&lt;X, Y> {
	void someCall(X x);
	Y someOtherCall();
}
&lt;T> void doSomething(T supplied, GenericClass&lt;? super T, ? extends T> arg) {
	arg.someCall(supplied);            // supply T for X, so super T for X
	T extracted = arg.someOtherCall(); // extract T for Y, so extends T for Y
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Answers</h2>

<p>
In short, Generics should be constrained based on what you need from them.
When you need a generic class, add constraints to its Generics based on how you need to interact with the generic class itself:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you don't have any type constraint for it, just use the wildcard <code>&lt;?></code> alone ;</li>
	<li>If for a specific Generics you need to extract a type T, then use <code>&lt;? extends T></code> (<em>ext</em>ract = <em>ext</em>ends) ;</li>
	<li>If for a specific Generics you need to supply a type T, then use <code>&lt;? super T></code> (<em>sup</em>ply = <em>sup</em>er) ;</li>
	<li>If for the same Generics you need both, then use <code>&lt;T></code> directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Just be aware that the more constraints you add, the less your code can be used elsewhere.
	So prefer to apply only those constraints that you actually need rather than immediately going for <code>&lt;T></code>.
	If you are not sure, just start with the wildcard <code>&lt;?></code>, then add the relevant constraints to make it compile.
