<h1>How to Delete a Git Commit with Its Content?</h1>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>
	Your branch contains a commit which applies changes that you don't want.
	It might be some obsolete or irrelevant changes for your branch, and you don't want to build on them anymore.
</p>
<p>
	If instead you want to remove a commit without removing its changes, then you need to <entry id="26">squash it</entry> with another one.
</p>

<h2 id="question">Question</h2>

<p>
	How to delete a Git commit with its content?
</p>

<h2 id="method">Method</h2>

<include src="git-rewrite-warning.html"/>

<p>
	If your commit contains changes that you want to keep, first <entry id="23">split it</entry> to extract those changes into a dedicated commit.
	You need to ensure that the commit you want to remove contains only changes that you want to remove.
</p>
<p>
	Before to remove the commit, you need to understand that removing some changes modifies the state of your code.
	Consequently, removing a commit may conflict with the next commits.
	If you are sure that removing this commit will not produce any conflict, then you can do so in one go:
</p>
<pre><code>
COMMIT_LAST=$(git rev-parse HEAD)          # Identify the last commit
COMMIT=&lt;commit SHA-1&gt;                      # Identify the commit to remove
git reset --hard ${COMMIT}~1               # Place the branch on the commit before the one to remove
git cherry-pick ${COMMIT}..${COMMIT_LAST}  # Apply the commits after the removed one
</code></pre>
<p>
	If the conflicts do not scare you, you can use the same procedure and resolve the conflicts during the <code>cherry-pick</code>.
</p>
<p>
	If you feel unsafe regarding the conflicts, prefer first to <entry id="23">move the commit</entry> at the last position.
	Any conflict will be dealt with during this phase, one at a time.
	Once your commit is the last one, it is nothing more than a single change on which nothing builds on.
	Just cut the head of your banch to remove it:
</p>
<pre><code>
git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>

<h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

<p>
	Deleting a commit with its content is done by forgetting the history with <code>git reset --hard</code> and reproducing the commits to keep with <code>git cherry-pick</code>.
	However, conflicts may occur during the picking.
	To go more iteratively, one can first <entry id="23">move the commit</entry> at the last position.
	In this case, <code>git reset --hard</code> suffices to delete the last commit.
