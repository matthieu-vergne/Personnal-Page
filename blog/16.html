<!-- TODO -->
We ignore the definitions related to sports in particular, like the goal in soccer or in a race.
- <q>Goal</q> from <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/goal">Cambridge Dictionaries</a>:
	- <q>an aim or purpose</q>, in other words a result that one intends to reach or the reason why one does something.
- <q>Goal</q> from <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/goal">Oxford Dictionaries</a>:
	- <q>an aim or desired result</q>, concepts that the dictionary again relates to the notion of purpose (a reason why), intention, and desired outcome.
	- <q>the object of a person's ambition or effort</q>, which again relates to the desire of someone to achieve something.
- <q>Goal</q> from <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/goal">Merriam-Webster</a>:
	- <q>the end toward which effort is directed</q>, as a synonym of aim, i.e. a clearly directed intent or purpose.

<h3 id="formalisation_preparation">Informal Summary Before Proper Formalisation</h3>

<p>
All these definitions link as synonyms the notions of goal, aim, and purpose, but two perspectives can be highlighted: the <em>future result</em> that one desires to produce and the <em>current reason</em> which motivates the act.
The future result put an emphasis on the future, such that we act in order to change the state of the world progressively towards a state that we deem as valuable.
Nervertheless, the future result does not exist at the current time, which means that we can only speak about an <em>expected</em> result, such that the action we plan to execute should, to the best of our knowledge, leads this expected result to become true.
This is where the current reason is established: one acts based on the incentives it has at the moment of the action, and the reason why one acts can be because this action is &mdash;currently&mdash; expected to lead to a wanted result.
If we remain loose on the interpretation of the term, other reasons could be considered, like daily routine: although thinking about it may lead to remember the future state we expect to reach through this ation, the actual incentive leading to act is the habit.
This example, and a more broader notion of <em>cause</em>, is however irrelevant in our case, because we loose the intentional aspect that goal, aim, and purpose have been defined with.
If we want to keep this intention then we may speak about trials or attempts, but again these actions can be done in order to reach a wanted future which is less specific, like find an answer to a question rather than proove that a particular answer is the right one.
We may speak about actions where we don't know what could be the result of an action, like a random trial, but it seems hard to explain such an action without an automatism or an intention to reach a wanted future.
In short, we summarise our interpretation of a goal as a desired future state.

<!-- TODO Unwanted future: it might be true now, but not in the future, and thus the goal is not about a wanted future, because we already have it, but an unwanted future, as we expect a future that we want to avoid. -->
<!-- TODO Future as not having it now. -->
