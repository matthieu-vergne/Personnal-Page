We ignore the definitions related to sports in particular, like the goal in soccer or in a race.
- <q>Goal</q> from <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/goal">Cambridge Dictionaries</a>:
	- <q>an aim or purpose</q>, in other words a result that one intends to reach or the reason why one does something.
- <q>Goal</q> from <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/goal">Oxford Dictionaries</a>:
	- <q>an aim or desired result</q>, concepts that the dictionary again relates to the notion of purpose (a reason why), intention, and desired outcome.
	- <q>the object of a person's ambition or effort</q>, which again relates to the desire of someone to achieve something.
- <q>Goal</q> from <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/goal">Merriam-Webster</a>:
	- <q>the end toward which effort is directed</q>, as a synonym of aim, i.e. a clearly directed intent or purpose.

<h3 id="formalisation_preparation">Informal Summary Before Proper Formalisation</h3>

<p>
All these definitions link as synonyms the notions of goal, aim, and purpose, but two perspectives can be highlighted: the <em>future result</em> that one desires to produce and the <em>current reason</em> which motivates the act.
The future result put an emphasis on the future, such that we act in order to change (or maintain) the state of the world progressively towards a state that we deem as valuable.
Nervertheless, the future result does not exist at the current time (it might be already the case, but we want it to be the case in the future too), which means that we can only speak about an <em>expected</em> result, such that the action we plan to execute should, to the best of our knowledge, leads this expected result to become (or remain) true.
This is where the current reason is established: one acts based on the incentives it has at the moment of the action, and the reason why one acts can be because this action is &mdash;currently&mdash; expected to lead to a wanted future result.
If we remain loose on the interpretation of the term, other reasons could be considered, like daily routine: although thinking about it may lead to remember the future state we expect to reach through this ation, the actual incentive leading to act is the habit.
This example, and a more broader notion of <em>cause</em>, is however irrelevant in our case, because we loose the intentional aspect that goal, aim, and purpose have been defined with.
If we want to keep this intention then we may speak about trials or attempts, but again these actions can be done in order to reach a wanted future, possibly less specific, like find an answer to a question rather than proove that a particular answer is the right one, but still a wanted future.
We may speak about actions where we don't know what could be the future result of an action, like a random trial, but it seems hard to explain such an action without an automatism or an intention to reach a wanted future through evolutions we think to be probable.
In short, the main interpretation we reach when sepaking about a goal is a desired, future state of the world.<!-- TODO Cite papers about that, check RE -->
</p>

<p>
One should however not fall in the shortcut of considering a goal as a delta between the current state of the world and the desired one: it is possible to already have the desired state, but to expect it to vanish if no proper action is executed.
An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability">Unstable state</a>, like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pendulum">inverted pendulum</a>, is of this kind: we first act to reach a desired state and, when this state is reached, we act in order to maintain it.
In such a situation, the goal does not come from the unsatisfaction of the current state, but from the expectation that the future state will be different from the future state we want to have.
Thus, the goal is not motivated by the difference between the current and the wanted state, but between two expected future states: the one expected if no (good) action is performed, and the one expected the other way around.
Nevertheless, the current state remain important, because we cannot infer the future state from the action alone, we need to know in which context this action is performed.
This is where the current state becomes important: this is the combination of the current state and the (absence of) action which leads to the (expected) future state.
The particular case of comparing the current state to the desired one occurs when one expect the current state to remain stable, in other words it is a shortcut to inferring first the natural future state and then comparing it to the desired state.
In brief, a goal occurs when identifying a difference between two future states: the one we expect to occur naturally from the current state, and the one we want to reach from this same current state.
This goal leads then to perform some actions such that the future state we expect to happen becomes our desired state or come closer to it.
