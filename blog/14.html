- <q>Relevant</q> from <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/relevant">Cambridge Dictionaries</a>:
	- <q>connected with what is happening or being discussed</q> seems rather neutral by establishing a mere relation but, because something unrelated to the matter at hand can be formally related to it with the relationship <q>is unrelated to</q>, everything can be related to anything<!-- TODO Support it with citation -->. This means that we should not speak about a mere relation but something stronger.
	- <q>correct or suitable for a particular purpose</q> highlights this aspect, establishing that the relation should be supported by the purpose of the matter at hand, thus a goal-driven perspective.
- <q>Relevant</q> from <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/relevant">Oxford Dictionaries</a>:
	- <q>closely connected or appropriate to what is being done or considered.</q> confirm this notion of some relations being more valuable than others because they are closer. A distance for which the dimension should be chosen depending on the need, bringing again a goal-driven perspective.
- <q>Relevant</q> from <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/relevant">Merriam-Webster</a>:
	- <q>having significant and demonstrable bearing on the matter at hand</q> highlights again the valuable aspect of the element through its <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/significant">significance</a>, which should be <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demonstrated">demonstrable</a> rather than merely stated. Two aspects which support again the need to establish a goal-driven perspective from which such a value can be inferred.
	- <q>affording evidence tending to prove or disprove the matter at issue or under discussion</q>, a particular case where the goal is to prove something, such that a relevant element is an element which can be used in this proof.
	- <q>having social relevance</q>, a particular case where the goal relates to social relationships, such as people interests or needs. Despite its circularity, this social aspect is an important one when speaking about the expertise of people<!-- TODO Why? -->.

The definitions we saw so far establish a relevant element as an element which shows some positive value in regard to the goal one wants to achieve.

Wilson, Deirdre, and Dan Sperber. “Relevance Theory.” In The Handbook of Pragmatics, edited by Laurence R. Horn and Gregory L. Ward, 607–32. Blackwell Handbooks in Linguistics. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2004. doi:10.1002/9780470756959.
- Introduction of the book (Horn, Laurence R., and Gregory L. Ward, eds. The Handbook of Pragmatics. Blackwell Handbooks in Linguistics. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2004. doi:10.1002/9780470756959.):
	- <q>Pragmatics as a field of linguistic inquiry was initiated in the 1930s by Morris, Carnap, and Peirce, for whom syntax addressed the formal relations of signs to one another, semantics the relation of signs to what they denote, and pragmatics the relation of signs to their users and interpreters (Morris 1938). In this program, pragmatics is the study of those context-dependent aspects of meaning which are systematically abstracted away from in the construction of content or logical form. [...] It should be noted, however, that other traditions – especially among European scholars – tend to employ a broader and more sociological conception of pragmatics that encompasses all aspects of language use not falling strictly within formal linguistic theory [...]. For reasons of space and coherence of presentation, we have largely restricted our coverage to the more narrowly circumscribed, mainly Anglo-American conception of linguistic and philosophical pragmatics and its applications.</q><!-- TODO Centered on signs/language, so might be rather superficial regarding cognitive aspects of relevance. -->
	- <q>[Chapter 16 of] Herb Clark develops the (now uncontroversial) idea advanced by Grice, Lewis, and others that language is a fundamentally cooperative venture.</q><!-- TODO Language aspect should be constructed, not implemented a priori. There might have a preliminary implementation, but it should be adaptable. Read the related chapter for more info. -->
- Relations with Grice's framework:<!-- TODO Investigate to better understand relevance theory. -->
	- <q>Relevance theory may be seen as an attempt to work out in detail one of Grice's central claims: that an essential feature of most human communication is the expression and recognition of intentions (Grice 1989: Essays 1–7, 14, 18; Retrospective Epilogue).</q>
	- <q>The relevance-theoretic account is based on another of Grice's central claims: that utterances automatically create expectations which guide the hearer toward the speaker's meaning. Grice described these expectations in terms of a Cooperative Principle and maxims of Quality (truthfulness), Quantity (informativeness), Relation (relevance), and Manner (clarity), which speakers are expected to observe (Grice 1961, 1989: 368–72).</q>
	- <q>We share Grice's intuition that utterances raise expectations of relevance, but question several other aspects of his account, including the need for a Cooperative Principle and maxims, the focus on pragmatic contributions to implicit (as opposed to explicit) content, the role of maxim violation in utterance interpretation, and the treatment of figurative utterances.</q>
- History in several stages: <q>A detailed version was published in <q>Relevance: Communication and Cognition</q> (Sperber and Wilson 1986a, 1987a, b) and updated in Sperber and Wilson (1995, 1998a, 2002) and Wilson and Sperber (2002).</q>
- Central claim: <q>expectations of relevance raised by an utterance are precise and predictable enough to guide the hearer toward the speaker's meaning.</q>
- Aim: <q>explain in cognitively realistic terms what these expectations amount to, and how they might contribute to an empirically plausible account of comprehension.</q>
- Relevance:
	- Relevance is a potential property of observable phenomena, thoughts, memories, and conclusions of inferences. Any external stimulus or internal representation which provides an input to cognitive processes may be relevant to an individual at some time<!-- TODO Highlight that it is relevant TO someone, not relevant per se, and AT some time, not all the time. -->.
	- An input is relevant to an individual when its processing in a context of available assumptions yields a positive cognitive effect<!-- TODO Clearly about subjective relevance, as opposed to objective relevance which may make a negative effect when someone's belief is hurt (e.g. discovering that Santa Claus is a fiction). It is important for me to speak about relevance from the point of view of a domain, thus not restricting on the relevance felt by a single individual. -->.
	- A positive cognitive effect is a worthwhile difference to the individual's representation of the world <!-- TODO May relate to the disconfirmation of expectancies. -->. False conclusions are cognitive effects, but not positive ones, as opposed to true conclusions, which makes the latter potentially relevant as opposed to the former.<!-- TODO Although they speak about positive cognitive effects, the example used of a late train seems rather negative, so more investigation is needed to understand better what they mean by positive. It seems to build on the notion of "worth" used here, but worth and relevant seems rather synonymous, so it should be clarified to not hide a cyclic definition: a false conclusion seems to be considered as not worth, but why? -->
	- Relevance is a matter of degree, or more precisely a matter of comparison, based on cognitive effect and processing effort<!-- TODO They take a relative dimension only, although we may consider an absolute stance too as a simplification. -->. Other things being equal, the greater the positive cognitive effects achieved by processing an input, the greater its relevance will be.<!-- TODO Do we speak about actual or potential cognitive effects? Given we are comparing these effects, probably we speak about potential ones, which seems better because the context may lead to ignore some highly relevant things, despite them being still highly relevant. -->. Other things being equal, the greater the processing effort required, the less relevant the input will be.<!-- TODO May relate to the transition from expectancy disconfirmation to expectancy confirmation, usually through explanation production, like bridging a discrepancy to an existing piece of knowledge to make sense of it. If this transition is quick, it gives a positive feeling of surprise, like a feeling of novelty, while a larger time to make sense strengthen the feeling of discrepancy, making it just unsuited. Thus, novelty and relevance appear to be related, and to build on the ability to quickly make sense of a discrepancy. -->.
- Cognitive Principle of Relevance: Human cognition tends to be geared to the maximization of relevance, not because we have a choice in the matter but because of the way our cognitive systems have evolved, as a result of constant selection pressures toward increasing efficiency.
- Cognitive effects:
	- Contextual implication: <q>a conclusion deducible from input and context together, but from neither input nor context alone. For example, on seeing my train arriving, I might look at my watch, access my knowledge of the train timetable, and derive the contextual implication that my train is late</q>
	- Strengthening, revision, or abandonment of available assumptions: <q>For example, the sight of my train arriving late might confirm my impression that the service is deteriorating, or make me alter my plans to do some shopping on the way to work.</q><!-- TODO May relate to the consequences of expectancy disconfirmation: ignoring, tagging, bridging, or revising. -->
	- <q>According to relevance theory, an input is relevant to an individual when, and only when, its processing yields such positive cognitive effects.</q>  (the list is non exhaustive, though)
- Communication:
	- Informative intention: The intention to inform an audience of something. Alone, it is not sufficient to ensure the establishement of a communication, because the resulting action may lead the information to be provided by the communicator but not grasped by the audience. For example, putting one's empty glass in the vision field of the audience to ask for a refill, while hoping that the audience will notice and understand it without direct interaction with the communicator.
	- Communicative intention: The intention to inform the audience of one's informative intention. The resulting action would lead the communicator to ensure that the audience grasp the information for proper reaction. For example, calling the audience before to show the empty glass.
	- Ostensive-inferential communication: acting in order to fulfil both an informative intention with a related communicative intention. It involves the use of an ostensive stimulus, designed to attract an audience's attention and focus it on the communicator's meaning.
