<h1>How to present as a professional?</h1>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

&lt;Describe the context which makes the question worth.&gt;

<h2 id="question">Question</h2>

&lt;Complete question&gt;

<h2 id="method">Method</h2>

&lt;TODO&gt;
<p>
    In the following, we will see various requirements your audience may have.
</p>
<p>
    These guidelines can be applied to any type of presentation.
    Whether they are oral presentations or written documents.
    Whether they are one or few sentences summaries or hour-long discourses.
    Whether they are activity reports or teachings.
</p>

<h3 id="method-message">Bring a Message</h2>

<p>
    Presenting is a retrospective activity: we present something we have already thought about or done.
    As such, preparing a presentation starts once we identify something interesting to say.
    As such, the first thing to think about as a presenter is that final message the audience should remember.
</p>
<p>
    The message may evolve during the preparation (or even during the presentation).
    It does not have to be finalized from the start.
    New ideas and ways to present may come during the preparation.
    Those evolutions may however require significant adaptations to the presentation.
    In any case, the presentation should be driven by that final message the audience should remember.
</p>

<h3 id="method-message">Make it Obvious</h2>

<p>
    Once the message is chosen, it is important to build on the knowledge of the audience.
    Depending on your message, you may require more or less explanation and details.
    But if you don't speak about something known by the audience, it won't make sense to them.
</p>
<p>
    The explanation goes through successive supports until we reach common knowledge for the audience.
    In other words, the final message should be directly supported by some motivations.
    Then, these motivations should themselves be supported by further motivations.
    The loop ends when the only motivations required are assumed to be already known by the audience.
</p>
<p>
    For example, the final message could be that a feature has been successfully implemented.
    We may support this claim by providing testing results showing some tests have passed.
    We may support the relevance of these tests by describing which aspects are tested.
    We may support the relevance of these aspects by refering to the requirements of the project.
    If we assume the reader knows the requirements, we don't need further motivations.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on how you want to support the message, you may choose different supporting paths.
    You may favor a path which uses well known supports in your domain for a better familiarity.
    You may favor a path which uses the least number of steps for a stronger evidence.
    You may show multiple paths to strengthen the support, but be careful to not confuse the audience.
</p>
<p>
    The whole point is that the presentation will go the other way around.
    You will first start with the things known by your audience, so they can understand where you start from.
    Then you will unroll your claims, ensuring it makes sense from the previous ones.
    Finally, you will reach your final message.
    If you present everything smoothly, the message should make sense to the audience too.
</p>

<h3 id="method-message">Make it Relevant</h2>

<p>
    Once the message is chosen and the path to it secured, you must catch the attention of the audience.
    If you speak about something they know but don't make it sound interesting, they may prefer to do something else.
    And it is harder to get people back than to catch them from the start.
</p>
<p>
    You should put your presentation into a relevant context.
    It does not have to be the context you actually faced.
    You don't even have to limit yourself to one context.
    The point is to make the audience think that what you have to say may interest them.
    The closer your context is close to theirs, the better they can relate to what you are going to present.
</p>
<p>
    General guidelines for presentations go further by suggesting to tell a story all along the presentation.
    Introducing some fun in the presentation is certainly a good way to keep people engaged and interested.
    However, in a professional context, it is not only unnecessary, but it may backfire.
    If you abuse the story part, your may give your presentation a taste of "toy" project.
    And professionals have more interesting things to do than play around.
    So it may be a good idea, but focus on that only once you have all the serious stuff ready.
</p>

<h3 id="method-message">Target the Audience</h2>

<p>
    Since it all start with catching the audience on something they know, knowing your audience is critical.
    If you don't know what is your audience, you must confirm it first.
</p>
<p>
    Since you must know which audience to target, ensure it does not become excessively heterogeneous.
    If it has some heterogeneity (e.g. professors and students), target the least knowledgeable members (e.g. students).
    If your audience is too heterogeneous (e.g. experts and public), you will either bore some of them or loose the others.
    In this extreme case, prefer to split into several presentations, each targeted to a more homogeneous audience.
</p>

<h3 id="method-message">Don't Fool Yourself</h2>

<p>
    Some people will catch your mistakes, or ask questions wich may completely turn around your presentation.
    But this is not a bad thing, rather the opposite.
    It means you interested them enough to make them think further about it.
    This is the opportunity to get interesting feedback for yourself.
</p>
<p>
    However, you should not fail to reply to these comments.
    You should be prepared by remaining suspicious about your own presentation.
    Take your presentation and list all the good points you present.
    Try to evaluate their importance, between minor stuff and critical argument.
    Then, try to find as much bad points, with similar importance.
    You may go the other way around, starting from bad and then looking for good.
</p>
<p>
    The goal is to ensure you keep a balanced view of your work.
    Other people will always find something more, either good or bad.
    You don't have to know the answer, but you should be ready to receive the question.
    Just thank your audience if it makes you think about something you didn't.
</p>

<h3 id="method-objectiveSubjective">Objective and Subjective Matters</h2>

<p>
    When presenting a professional matter, it is important to remain as objective as possible.
    The audience don't have to share your own opinions and values.
</p>
<p>
    However, some elements may be motivated by subjective matters, like decisions.
    In order to understand these decisions, it might be useful to present their basis.
    However, it should be done in an objective way.
    The point is to state that these decisions have been taken based on those subjective matters.
    It is not the purpose of the presenter to find new motivations of past decisions.
</p>
<p>
    It may be expected from the presenter to take a step ahead and draw plans or expectations about the future.
    For example, someone in charge must be able to take further actions and state them.
    In this case, the opinions and values of the presenter may be expected.
    But this is a different job, and it occurs at a different time.
    Taking the hat of the person in charge, one may take new decisions based on the content of the presentation.
    Taking back the hat of the presenter, one should state which decisions were taken on the bases of which motivations.
</p>
<p>
    In short, subjective matters may be presented.
    But they should always be stated in an objective way to explain past decisions.
</p>

<h3 id="method-STEPS">Putting everything together: follow the STEPS</h2>

To write your report, you should follow the STEPS:
<dl>
    <dt>Situation</dt>
    <dd>Objective statements to support the understanding of the report.</dd>
    <dt>Trigger</dt>
    <dd>Subjective statements to support the need for evolution.</dd>
    <dt>Evolution</dt>
    <dd>Objective statements to list the actions taken to evolve the context.</dd>
    <dt>Product</dt>
    <dd>Objective statements describing the new state of the context, reached once all actions have been taken.</dd>
    <dt>Study</dt>
    <dd>Subjective analysis of the Trigger, Evolution, and Product.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
    The objective steps <em>may</em> describe subjective matters, like opinions, problems, ideas, etc.
    However, they should be stated for the sole purpose of reporting them because they help to understand the report.
    More generally, subjective matters may appear anywhere but should be stated depending on the prupose.
    For example, the management may receive complaints about how hard it is to work in the current environment.
    These complaints would be the <em>Trigger</em> to some actions taken to improve the working environment.
    Later, the management may wonder to which extent it has improved and run some interviews to get feedback.
    In the next report, the complaints would be part of the <em>Situation</em> while the improvement uncertainty would be the <em>Trigger</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The Trigger is <em>always subjective</em>, even when it involves objective indicators.
    The whole point is to <em>decide</em> to act, and indicators are not enough for that.
    Indicators provide information, but deciding whether they should be considered and where are the thresholds is a subjective matter.
    When the decision is backed by a strict policy to follow, the opinions are those which have motivated the policy.
    Reminding them in the report helps to get a better grasp of the reasons of the change.
</p>

<h3 id="method-pastPresentFuture">Context: Past, Present, and Future</h2>

<p>
    The first purpose of a report is to state what <em>have been</em> done.
    It summarises the past to help the reader understand the current state of affairs.
    This understanding may then help to decide about future actions to execute.
</p>
<p>
    One may remark that a report could speak about future plans.
    Yet, it is still only a report of past investigations, thinking, and decisions.
    At the time the plan <em>was</em> made, the future <em>was</em> expected to run in a given way.
    The plan then helps to drive the present as long as this expectation holds.
    Reporting about future plans is mainly about stating the past expectations in the light of the past information.
    At best, it is about plans that can be made <em>at the time of writing the report</em> based on the information it contains.
</p>
<p>
    As such, a report cannot claim about what <em>will</em> be.
    It can only report what <em>was</em>.
    If further plans are requested in the report, it must be based on the information it contains.
    If plans are drawn, it is by assuming they may be revised if more information comes later.
</p>

<h3 id="method-chronologyPurpose">Completeness vs. Relevance</h2>

<p>
    A trace is built on the fly, when we don't know yet what we can get out of it.
    As such, a trace should be <em>as complete as possible</em>.
    Indeed, we never know in advance what will be relevant at the end.
</p>
<p>
    A report, however, is built in a <em>retrospective</em> way.
    In other words, we write it once the actions are done and something interesting to report is identified.
    For example, we may have found something unexpected or just want to tell what has been achieved so far.
    In any case, there is a message to report to the reader which goes beyond the mere trace of what happened.
</p>
<p>
    Everything in the report should focus on bringing this message.
    As such, some events are more relevant than others.
    For unexpected events, the initial expectations and the events contradicting them will be of relevance.
    For some achievments, the plan followed and the results obtained will be more interesting.
</p>
<p>
    There is often many details which do not help (nor even relate) to the final message.
    These pieces of information should not be written in the report.
    When reporting about an unexpected bug, don't speak about what you ate at noon.
    When reporting about the successful implementation of a feature, let aside the small coding details.
</p>

<h3 id="method-chronologyConclusion">Chronology vs. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
    A trace focuses on aggregating everything worthy to be noted.
    It provides a full chronology of the events that occurred.
    The time and order of the events may show something interesting ina retrospective analysis.
</p>
<p>
    A report, however, should draw conclusions.
    We expect a report to teach something we may ignore.
    And like any teacher, it should explain how we reach these conclusions.
    The report must organise the information into relevant topics to help the understanding.
    The choice of the topics and their presentation should support the conclusions.
</p>
<p>
    In other words, a report is not necessarily chronological.
    Actually, it should avoid being chronological.
    Relevant events may occur randomly, so sticking to the chronology may make it hard to understand.
    A chronological presentation may be used, but only if it does help to draw the conclusions.
