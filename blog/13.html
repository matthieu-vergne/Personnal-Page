<h3>Dictionary Definitions</h3>

<!-- TODO -->
<p>
If we ignore definitions about brands and biology, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/generic">Merriam-Webster</a> defines something generic as <q>relating to or characteristic of a whole group or class</q> or <q>having no particularly distinctive quality or application</q>, in other words something which appears to be always present within a set of things.
We can highlight that it is not about mere redundancy, meaning being common in the group, but something which is redundant enough to be shared by every members of the group.
The <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/generic">Cambridge dictionary</a> remain on similar definitions, while the <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/generic">Oxford dictionary</a> also defines it as <q>not specific</q>, giving us a proper pair of opposites: generic versus specific.
</p>

<p>
This addition gives us the opportunity to look also for the definition of <q>specific</q>.
Starting from the <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/specific">Cambridge dictionary</a>, which is the simplest, we say that something is specific when <q>relating to one thing and not others</q>.
We ignore the alternative definition which makes it a synonymous of exact, which seems far from some opposition to generic.
Although the definition is rather absolute (we speak about a single thing), the examples illustrate mainly specificness applied to a class of (similar) things, like specific cells or specific purposes.
In other words, something specific appears to be something which pertains to a group of elements like generic, but at the opposite of generic which is shared by all the elements we may speak about, specific clearly entails the idea that there is other elements which do not pertain to this group.
Switching to the <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/specific">Oxford dictionary</a>, we retrieve the absolute definition of <q>belonging or relating uniquely to a particular subject</q> as well as the synonymous of exact.
We also have a definition closer to the meaning we identified in the Cambridge dictionary, with <q>relating to species or a species</q>, but as a biological interpretation only.
Other and more complex definitions are also given, but again without a clear idea of how it would oppose to the generic notion, which is a bit annoying given that it is this dictionary which defines generic as not specific.
It is finally <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/specific">Merriam-Webster</a> which provides the best description in regard to the raw idea we want to represent.
Indeed, although we retrieve the idea of specific as a synonym of exact, we also find several definitions of interest, like <q>constituting or falling into a specifiable category</q>, which we understand as something which can be expressed as a shared property for the elements of the category, a meaning better expressed by <q>sharing or being those properties of something that allow it to be referred to a particular category</q>.
We also retrieve the idea of a unique individual with <q>restricted to a particular individual, situation, relation, or effect</q>, but again illustrated with a group (i.e. <q>a disease specific to horses</q>).
We retrieve other definitions provided by the Oxford dictionary, but again they do not show a clear opposition to generic, thus we ignore them.
</p>

<p>
We may stop here, but there is a subtle detail to care about, which shows that generic and specific are not strictly opposed to each other.
Indeed, genericness implies that a property is shared through all the elements, while specificness implies that at least some elements do not, but it is not the only characteristic that specificness entails.
As we saw in the previous definitions, there should also have at least some elements which do have this property: a property which applies to no elements at all is not specific, in particular we cannot answer the question <q>what is it specific to?</q>.
Dictionary definitions always specifies that specific applies to identifiable elements, that the property is <em>specific to</em> a group of elements, so we can hardly use it to speak about a property which applies to nothing at all.
To better grasp the different characteristics and properly choose our wording, let's go back to the roots of these words.
</p>

<h3>A Bit of Etymology</h3>

<p>
Generic comes from the Latin word <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/genus#Latin">genus</a>, which means kind, type, species, or group.
Specific comes from the Latin word <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/specificus">specificus</a>, which is the composition of speciēs (kind) and faciō (make).
We see that both builds on the notion of kind, but with different terms: genus on one side and speciēs on the other.
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/species#Latin">Speciēs</a> is itself a derivation from <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/specio#Latin">speciō</a>, which means observing or watching.
As speciēs, we then speak about a view or appearance, thus a kind in the sense of an observable property, which leads us to interpret specificus as the ability to identify this property.
To identify a property, one should at least be able to discern when it applies and when it does not, so it makes sense to speak about something specific when we are able to identify both elements having the property and elements not having it.
On the other side, once we have established what is part of the group and what is not, then we can describe this part they all share, there shared <em>gene</em>.
For example, one could identify a property <em>specific</em> to some elements, highlighting how these elements differ from other elements, such that this property is <em>generic</em> to these elements, highlighting how these elements are similar independently of other elements.
</p>

<p>
Once the etymology of the words is clarified, we can then think about words which could express the missing characteristics that we need.
In particular, if a generic property is a genus shared in the whole group, how to express that such a genus is partially or totally absent from the group?
We may speak about <em>common</em> and <em>uncommon</em> properties, but these notions translate more the idea of majority: if a property is possessed by most of the elements of the group, it is common, while uncommon means that most of them do not have this property.
Some may think about using relationships used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meronymy">meronymy</a>, such that a property is a <em>member of</em> a group, but it would be a mistake: the members of the group are <em>elements</em> having properties, not properties directly.
We can say that a property is in (resp. out of) the group to avoid heavy sentences, but it should be interpreted as a property possessed by at least one element in (resp. out of) the group, not a direct membership relation between the property and the group.
Consequently, a property can be possessed by elements in the group only, elements out of the group only, or shared by elements in the group and out of it, a case that meronymy does not cover (one cannot be member <em>and</em> not member of a group).
Due to our inability to find existing words to properly convey our meanings, we look at different <a href="https://msu.edu/~defores1/gre/roots/gre_rts_afx_tab1.htm">prefixes</a> which could help us to oppose the notion of genericness:
</p>
<dl class="center">
<dt>a&ndash;</dt><dd>without, not</dd>
<dt>anti&ndash;</dt><dd>against</dd>
<dt>dis&ndash;</dt><dd>not, apart</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Building on the prefixes above, we can interpret <em>ageneric</em> as a property <em>without</em> genericness in the group, such that it covers also properties which can be found in the group but for which we know that there is at least one element not having it.
We can interpret <em>antigeneric</em> as a property <em>against</em> genericness in the group, or more formally which negates a generic property of the group, such that it can be possessed only by elements out of the group.
We can interpret <em>disgeneric</em> as a property <em>apart from</em> genericness in the group, which seems more ambiguous to us and could be interpreted in both the previous ways (i.e. apart from the ability of being generic or apart from elements having generic properties), so we favor the other terms in the following.
With these words, we do some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism">neologism</a>, hopefully not producing a mere <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiolect">idiolect</a>, but we are open to suggestions for improvements.
Of course we know that natural languages are subject to individual interpretations, and it is also true for prefixes like <a href="#Prindle1948">Lester M. Prindle</a> remind us efficiently, but we want to use words which can support at best the meaning we intend them to represent, and the most objective way to achieve this goal seems to engineer terms precisely for this purpose.
In summary, as shown in the figure below, we start from all the possible properties (biggest circle), remove the generic properties to obtain the ageneric ones, and remove the properties still possessed by elements in the group to obtain the antigeneric ones.

<h3>Preparation of the Formalisation</h3>

<p>
Now, several points can be clarified to better grasp how these concepts relate to elements in and out of the group, because they do not split the properties between properties only found in the group and properties only found out of it, as illustrated in the next figure.
Indeed, if we consider all properties, there is properties which can be possessed by elements in the group and elements out of it, like the property <q>being an element</q> which is shared by all the elements.
An ageneric property adds the constraint of having at least one element of the group not possessing it, but without constraining elements out of the group, thus it can again be possessed by both types of elements.
An antigeneric property, at the opposite, negates a generic property of the group, which means that elements in the group <em>necessarily</em> do not possess this property (because they possess the generic one), thus restricting antigeneric properties to elements out of the group only.
Several questions then may arise regarding how antigeneric properties and elements out of the group relate to each other.
A first question is whether or not <em>any element possessing an antigeneric property is out of the group</em>, which by definition is true because an antigeneric property can only be possessed by elements out of the group, but what makes it interesting is to answer the next question.
Indeed, we can also wonder whether or not <em>any element out of the group possesses an antigeneric property</em>, which can be answered positively because any group has a generic property <q>being part of the group</q> negated by the antigeneric property <q>being out of the group</q>, property which is common to all the elements out of the group.
From these two answers, we can already say that <strong>being out of the group is equivalent to having an antigeneric property</strong>, which already draws a strong tie between antigeneric properties and elements out of the group.
However, despite this equivalence, it is not because an element is out of the group that all its properties are antigeneric: any element possesses the property <q>being an element</q>, which is thus a generic property for any non-empty group, so any element has at least a generic property.
Not only this example shows that being out of the group does not mean having only antigeneric properties but, given a group, <strong>no element have only antigeneric properties</strong>.
These are important aspects that should be complied with when formalising our concepts, including the case of the empty group described next.
</p>

	</svg>
</figure>

<p>
The empty group is a particular case and should be carefully dealt with.
First, we consider whether or not <strong>any property possessed only by elements out of the group is antigeneric</strong>, which can be answered positively if we assume the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle">law of excluded middle</a>, which states that, for any element, a property is either possessed or not possessed by it.
With this assumption, a property possessed only by elements out of the group is negated by a property which is necessarily possessed by all the other elements, including all the elements in the group.
This negation is thus a generic property for the group, leading the negated property to be, by definition, an antigeneric property.
The empty group, however, brakes the logic: if the group is empty, then the negation is a generic property for the (empty) group, but any element having this generic property is itself out of the group, which makes this generic property also antigeneric, which is absurd (an element cannot be in <em>and</em> out of the group).
The case of the empty group thus lead to an undefined genericness, such that one cannot say whether a property is generic, ageneric, antigeneric, or, as we see next, specific.
</p>

<p>
As we can see so far, all these terms apply depending on the group considered, so a property can be generic for a given group but ageneric or antigeneric for another one.
Before to say whether a property is of a given kind, one should first specify the group of elements considered, which means that our formalisation cannot define them without including a dependence to this group either.
This is another requirement for us to comply with in our formalisation.
</p>

<p>
We can now close our analysis by summarising our interpretation of genericness and specificness based on the defined concepts, as illustrated in the figure below.
One may speak about a <em>generic</em> property for a group of elements, which is a property that every elements of the group has, while all the other properties are <em>ageneric</em>, which means that at least one element of the group does not have it.
<em>Antigeneric</em> properties are properties negating these generic properties, so only elements out of the group can have them.
<em>Specific</em> properties are the remaining: properties which are neither generic nor antigeneric, or ageneric properties which are not antigeneric, so not only they are not shared by all the elements of the group, but they are not totally absent either.

<h3>Preliminary Formalisation</h3>

<p>
For our formalisation, we build on the mathematical notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">sets</a>, such that a set \(S\) is a group of elements \(\{s_0, s_1, s_2, ...\}\).
We can express the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality">cardinality</a> of this set through \(|S| \in \mathbb{R}^+\) in order to know how many elements it contains.
We also need to speak about the properties possessed by these elements, which we model through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(mathematical_logic)">predicates</a> \(p: S \rightarrow \{\top, \bot\}\), so if \(p(s) = \top\) then \(s\) has the property \(p\), otherwise it does not have it or it has the opposite property \(\neg p\).
Beside the choice of using sets and predicates, other basic characteristics can be reminded, especially because they provide some support for the proofs of the next section.
We describe them below, show what they mean in our context from a formal perspective, and derive what we need for later reuse.
</p>

-------------------<!-- TODO -->
<p>
One of them is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction">law of noncontradiction</a>, which means that a property cannot be at the same time true and false, and from which we can infer that a set built on that assumption is necessarily empty:
</p>
\[\begin{align}
\nonumber
           & \forall s \in S, p(s) \wedge \neg p(s) = \bot\\
\label{eq:noncontradiction}
\Rightarrow& \{s \in S | p(s) \wedge \neg p(s) \} = \emptyset\\
\end{align}\]

<p>
The second one is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle">law of excluded middle</a>, which assumes that a property is either true or false, nothing else.
Such an assumption implies that a set which combines elements having a property \(p\) and elements not having it simply contains every elements:
</p>
\[\begin{align}
\nonumber
           & \forall s \in S, p(s) \vee \neg p(s) = \top\\
\label{eq:excludedMiddle}
\Rightarrow& \{s \in S | p(s) \vee \neg p(s) \} = S\\
\end{align}\]

<p>
The third property we will use relates to the cardinality of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality#Union_and_intersection">the union of sets</a>, which should not count twice the elements that we find in both sets:
</p>
\[\begin{align}
\label{eq:unionCardinality}
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|\\
\end{align}\]

<p>
From all these characteristics, we can infer that the cardinality of a set \(S\) can be expressed as the sum of the cardinalities of two sets: the set of the elements having a property \(p\) and the set of elements not having it, which we formalise below:
</p>
\[\begin{align}
\nonumber
|S| &= |\{ s \in S | p(s) \vee \neg p(s)\}| &(\text{Eq \eqref{eq:excludedMiddle}})\\
\nonumber
    &= |\{ s \in S | p(s) \}| + |\{ s \in S | \neg p(s)\}| - |\{ s \in S | p(s) \wedge \neg p(s)\}| &(\text{Eq \eqref{eq:unionCardinality}})\\
\label{eq:composition}
    &= |\{ s \in S | p(s) \}| + |\{ s \in S | \neg p(s)\}|&(\text{Eq \eqref{eq:noncontradiction}})\\
\end{align}\]

<h3>Formalisation of Strict Genericness and Specificness</h3>

<p>
Once the preliminary characteristics are identified, we can properly formalise our concepts of genericness and specificness based on the previous analysis of the terms.
First, we define genericness as a property \(p\) shared by all the elements of a set \(S\):
</p>
\[\begin{align}
\label{eq:formalGeneric}
generic(p, S) &= \forall s \in S, p(s) \\
\end{align}\]

<p>
At the opposite, a property which is not generic is ageneric:
</p>

\[\begin{align}
\label{eq:formalAgeneric}
ageneric(p, S) &= \neg generic(p, S) \\
\nonumber
               &= \exists s \in S, \neg p(s) \\
\end{align}\]

<p>
Going further, if a property is totally absent from the set, it is antigeneric:
</p>

\[\begin{align}
\label{eq:formalAntigeneric}
antigeneric(p, S) &= \forall s \in S, \neg p(s) \\
\end{align}\]

<p>
Thus, we see our two ways of negating genericness: ageneric is about negating the whole relation (\(generic\) vs. \(\neg generic\)) while antigeneric is about negating the generic property (\(p\) vs. \(\neg p\)).
From these definitions, we can then formally define specificness, starting from the last figure which shows how specific properties are neither generic nor antigeneric:
</p>

\[\begin{align}
\label{eq:formalSpecific}
specific(p, S) &= \neg generic(p,S) \wedge \neg antigeneric(p, S) \\
\nonumber      &= ageneric(p,S) \wedge \neg antigeneric(p, S) \\
\nonumber      &= (\exists s \in S, \neg p(s)) \wedge \neg (\forall s \in S, \neg p(s)) \\
\nonumber      &= (\exists s \in S, \neg p(s)) \wedge (\exists s \in S, p(s)) \\
\label{eq:formalSpecificDetailed}
               &= \exists s_1, s_2 \in S, \neg p(s_1) \wedge p(s_2) \\
\end{align}\]

<p>
This formalisation properly describes that a specific property is a property which applies at least to some elements in the set but not all of them, making the property specific to some elements in the set.
It is important to not read \(specific(p, S)\) as \(p\) being specific <em>to</em> the set \(S\), but being specific <em>in</em> the set, such that we can find a subset <em>to</em> which it is specific.
In other words, there is a set \(S_p \subset S\), which can be called the reduction of \(S\) through \(p\), such that \(0 &lt; |S_p| &lt; |S|\) (it is neither the empty set nor \(S\) itself) and \(generic(p, S_p)\).
At the opposite, the reduction of the set through a generic property leads to the set itself, while a reduction through an antigeneric property leads to the empty set.
This notion of reduction is formally described in the next section, where we use it extensively to establish an order between properties, but before to speak about orders, we should close this section, which still did not consider the extreme case of empty sets and how they apply to our definitions.
</p>

<p>
Although reductions can lead to having an empty set, we can also wonder what happens when \(S\) itself is empty: is there generic or specific properties with an empty set?
Equation \eqref{eq:formalSpecificDetailed} shows that no property can be specific in an empty set, because no element having (or not) the property exist in the empty set, or more informally we can say that there is no element (or subset) to which a property can be specific to.
Similarly, although it is hard to consider whether or not a property is generic to an empty set based on Equation \eqref{eq:formalGeneric}, it is clear from Equation \eqref{eq:formalAgeneric} that a property cannot be ageneric to the empty set for a similar reason than specificness.
By inference, properties can be considered as generic to the empty set.
Regarding antigeneric properties, we have the same problem than genericness, but it is clear from its negation that there is no element of the empty set which has the property, so by inference a property can be considered as antigeneric.
In other words, if \(S\) is empty, all properties are generic and antigeneric, which is not a contradiction if we focus on the formal definitions, and no property is specific or ageneric, which is again consistent with the formal definitions.
It is however interesting to highlight that the empty set is the only set for which a property can be at the same time generic and antigeneric, because as soon as the set has an element, the element cannot both have the property and not have it because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction">law of noncontradiction</a>.
</p>
<!-- TODO What about a set with 1 element? Specific should not apply, because it requires 2 elements -->

<h3>Formalisation of Degree of Genericness and Specificness</h3>

<p>
We may stop here, but the formalisation of genericness and specificness as boolean values is not the only interesting way to model them, and in particular it is not rare to describe something as more generic or more specific than another.
This leads to the need of describing degrees or levels of genericness and specificness, which we will call <em>genericity</em> and <em>specificity</em> to differentiate them from their boolean counterparts <em>generic</em> and <em>specific</em>.
To express degrees, we need to establish an order between properties based on some measures but, although a generic property can be considered as having more genericity than a specific one, we cannot order two specific properties based solely on the previous definitions.
To fix that, we will build on the previous observation we made, such that a property \(p\) specific in a set \(S\) can reduce the set to a subset \(S_p\) where this property is generic.
Thus, we need to formally define this reduction process, and we do so as follows:
</p>

\[\begin{align}
\label{eq:formalReduction}
reduction(p, S) &= \{s \in S | p(s)\} \\
\end{align}\]

<p>
This reduction is nothing more than a filter function which uses the predicate \(p\) to filter out irrelevant elements from \(S\), which allows us to infer several things.
First, if a property is generic to a set, then all the elements of the set has the property, such that no element is irrelevant, or more formally \(generic(p_1, S) \Rightarrow reduction(p_1, S) = S\).
At the opposite, if a property is antigeneric to a set, then no element of the set has the property, such that all elements are irrelevant, or more formally \(antigeneric(p_2, S) \Rightarrow reduction(p_2, S) = \emptyset\).
In between, we can speak about specific properties, which are neither generic nor antigeneric, which means that their reductions will be at the same time smaller than the set but also non empty, or more formally \(specific(p_3, S) \Rightarrow reduction(p_3, S) \in 2^S \setminus \{S, \emptyset\}\).
From this, we can establish an order between the reductions of the properties, such that \(reduction(p_2, S) \subset reduction(p_3, S) \subset reduction(p_1, S)\).
We can also see that this kind of order applies also between specific properties if the reduction of one specific property is included in the reduction of another specific property.
</p>

<p>
Although this subset ordering provides a nice support to express degrees of genericness and specificness, it is still incomplete, because we cannot order two specific properties if they are disjoint or if they only partially overlap.
We may consider them as equal, but if we take a set of 10 elements and split it into two disjoint subsets of 9 elements and 1 element, it seems hard to motivate that the subset of 9 elements has as much specificity than the subset of 1 element.
Consequently, instead of considering an order based on the reductions themselves, we consider an order based on their cardinality, which leads us to define genericity as:
</p>

\[\begin{align}
\label{eq:formalGenericity}
genericity(p, S) &= \frac{|reduction(p, S)|}{|S|} \\
\end{align}\]

<p>
Now, we can compute the genericity of each of the three properties we used before, with the generic property \(p_1\) having a genericity of 1, the antigeneric \(p_2\) having a genericity of 0, and the genericity of a specific property \(p_3\) between the two previous values.
Thus, we obtain an order of the properties such that \(genericity(p_2, S) &lt; genericity(p_3, S) &lt; genericity(p_1, S)\), like the subset order we saw before.
Similarly, if the reduction of a specific property is included in the reduction of another specific property, the genericity of the former is also lower than the genericity of the latter, giving again the same order than before.
Additionally, if two reductions are disjoint or overlapping, they will be equal only if they have the same number of elements, while a bigger (resp. smaller) reduction gives a higer (resp. lower) genericity to its property.
It is important to notice that a property is more generic than another <em>given a set \(S\)</em>, while comparing \(genericity(p_1, S_1)\) and \(genericity(p_2, S_2)\) does not allow to tell which one is more generic than the other because they are computed on different contexts.
</p>

<p>
During our analysis of the notions of genericness and specificness, we saw that generic and specific are not formally negating each other, in the sense that a generic property is negated by an ageneric property, while a specific property is not only ageneric but also non antigeneric.
Similarly, it seems odd to define a notion of specificity simply opposed to genericity because a specificity of 1 would mean that the property is antigeneric, which conflicts with our definition of specific given in Equation \eqref{eq:formalSpecific}.
Rather, we can define the antigenericity to measure this value, ensuring tha we remain consistent with our previous definitions:
</p>

\[\begin{align}
\label{eq:formalAntigenericity}
antigenericity(p, S) &= 1 - genericity(p, S) \\
\nonumber            &= 1 - \frac{|reduction(p, S)|}{|S|} &(\text{Eq. \eqref{eq:formalGenericity}})\\
\nonumber            &= \frac{|S|}{|S|} - \frac{|reduction(p, S)|}{|S|} \\
\nonumber            &= \frac{|S| - |reduction(p, S)|}{|S|} \\
\nonumber            &= \frac{|S \setminus reduction(p, S)|}{|S|} &(reduction(p, S) \in S)\\
\nonumber            &= \frac{|S \setminus \{s \in S | p(s)\}|}{|S|} &(\text{Eq. \eqref{eq:formalReduction}})\\
\nonumber            &= \frac{|\{s \in S | \neg p(s)\}|}{|S|} \\
\label{eq:formalAntigenericityDetailed}
                     &= \frac{|reduction(\neg p, S)|}{|S|} &(\text{Eq. \eqref{eq:formalReduction}})\\
\end{align}\]

<p>
Then, an antigenericity of 0 would mean that the property is generic, and antigenericity of 1 would mean that the property is antigeneric, and a value in between that the property is specific.
We obtain again an order, like with genericity, but for which the order is reversed such that \(antigenericity(p_2, S) > antigenericity(p_3, S) > antigenericity(p_1, S)\).
Of course, like for genericity, this order also applies to specific properties depending on the size of their reductions, thus being defined whether or not they overlap.
</p>

<p>
Finally, what about specificity? Should we consider that antigenericity <em>is</em> the formal definition we build on when saying that a property is more specific than another?
If we focus on properties which are not antigeneric, the order is indeed consistent, because properties which applies to a lower subset of elements are considered as more specific.
Thus, if we restrict to the ordering aspect, the work is done, but it may seem to some that we are taking a shortcut to avoid the <em>actual</em> work, the one which leads to a final, complete answer.
The issue here is that our definition of specific does not allow to build a definition of specificity in the same way than we did for genericity and antigenericity.
Indeed, a property is generic only when all elements of the set has it, such that a genericity of 1 occurs only in this case and removing elements one after the other allows to decrease the genericity.
Similarly, a property is antigeneric only when no element of the set has it, such that an antigenericity of 1 occurs only in this case and adding elements one after the other allows to decrease the antigenericity.
However, a property is specific as soon as 1 elements has it and 1 elements does not, such that a lot of addition and removal can be made without changing the fact that the property is specific, leading to have a specificity of 1.
This makes the relevance of such a specificity measure particularly low, because it would be 1 if the property is specific, and 0 otherwise.
To satisfy the purists, we see several ways to design a specificity measure which (i) provides the same order than antigenericity and (ii) compute a value in [0;1] only when the property applies to at least one element of the set, thus ignoring the antigeneric cases and focusing on opposing genericity.

<h3>Linear Specificity</h3>

<p>
A first way to design a specificity function is by designing a linear function which returns 0 for generic properties, called \(p \rightarrow S\), and 1 for properties reducing to 1 element, called \(p \rightarrow 1\).
<!-- TODO Graph of the function -->
In other words a function of the shape \(f(x) = a.x + b\), which translates in our domain as:
</p>

\[\begin{align}
\nonumber
specificity_{lin}(p, S) &= slope(p, S) |reduction(p, S)| + intercept(p, S) \\
\end{align}\]

<p>
The slope is the ratio between \(\Delta_y\) and \(\Delta_x\), which in our case is:
</p>

\[\begin{align}
\nonumber
slope(p, S)       &= \frac{specificity(p \rightarrow S, S) - specificity(p \rightarrow 1, S)}{|reduction(p \rightarrow S, S)| - |reduction(p \rightarrow 1, S)|} \\
\nonumber
                  &= \frac{0 - 1}{|S| - 1} \\
\nonumber
				  &= \frac{-1}{|S|-1} \\
\end{align}\]

<p>
The intercept is the \(y\) value reached when \(x = 0\), thus:
</p>

\[\begin{align}
\nonumber
intercept(p, S)   &= specificity(p \rightarrow S, S) - slope(p, S) |reduction(p \rightarrow S, S)| \\
\nonumber
                  &= 0 - \frac{-1}{|S|-1}|S| \\
\nonumber
				  &= \frac{|S|}{|S|-1} \\
\end{align}\]

<p>
Which gives us the following expression of specificity:
</p>

\[\begin{align}
\nonumber
specificity_{lin}(p, S) &= \frac{-1}{|S|-1} |reduction(p, S)| + \frac{|S|}{|S|-1} \\
\nonumber
                        &= \frac{|S|-|reduction(p, S)|}{|S|-1} \\
\nonumber
                        &= \frac{|S \setminus reduction(p, S)|}{|S|-1} &(reduction(p, S) \in S)\\
\nonumber
                        &= \frac{|S \setminus \{s \in S | p(s)\}|}{|S|-1} &(\text{Eq. \eqref{eq:formalReduction}})\\
\nonumber
                        &= \frac{|\{s \in S | \neg p(s)\}|}{|S|-1} \\
\label{eq:formalSpecificityLinear}
                        &= \frac{|reduction(\neg p, S)|}{|S|-1} &(\text{Eq. \eqref{eq:formalReduction}})\\
\end{align}\]

<p>
This expression is almost equal to the antigenericity expression because it builds on the same shape, excepted that the normalisation factor is based on \(|S|-1\) elements instead of \(|S|\), which makes sense because we want to reach 1 when only 1 element remains in the reduction of the property, not 0.
The advantage of this expression is that it is indeed the closest to the antigenericity expression, thus providing a highly similar behaviour, but this function is also defined for antigeneric properties, to which they provide a value above 1.
IT is worth to note that this function is not defined when there is only 1 element in the set, which makes sense because no specific property can exist in such a set (our definition requires at least 2 elements, one with and another without the property).
Additionally, the function returns a specificity of 0 for an empty set, which is consistent with what we found for the boolean specificness (no property can be specific with an empty set).
</p>

<h3>Logarithmic Specificity</h3>

<p>
A second way to compute specificity is to focus on a function which is actually undefined when the property is antigeneric.
An example of such function is the logarithm, which is undefined in 0 (or return negative infinity if we accept such values), such that \(log(|reduction(p, S)|)\) makes a good candidate to build a specificity function.
However, with a growing reduction, we go beyond 1, so we should normalise it based on the size of \(S\), leading us to use \(log(|S|)\) as a normalisation factor.
This expression indeed provides us a value of 0 for a reduction having a single element and a value of 1 for a reduction of a generic property, which is exactly... the opposite of what we aim for.
Consequently, we can simply reverse the function to obtain what we want:
</p>

\[\begin{align}
\label{eq:formalSpecificityLogarithmic}
specificity_{log}(p, S) &= 1 - \frac{log(|reduction(p, S)|)}{log(|S|)} \\
\end{align}\]

<p>
Again, the order is the same than for the antigenericity, but although an antigeneric property returns no value (or positive infinity), the non linear shape of the function makes it less usual.
Regarding the empty set, one should see that the reduction leads to the same empty set, which means that the quotient should be equal to 1 and the overall function to 0, like the linear specificity.
However, in practice, depending on the way this expression is computed, it can lead to an undefined value (or positive infinity), which is an additional inconvenient if one wants to cover the case of the empty set.
In the case of a set with a single element, two cases are possible: if the property does not apply, the value is undefined, while if it does, the same reasoning than before leads to an undefined value or 0 depending on the way the expression is computed.
</p>

<p>
In summary, the linear specificity seems more interesting on several aspects, like the simplicity to compute it and its compatibility with the boolean definition of specificness.
Other expressions might be better than the logarithmic version we provide, but unless the context of use makes the disadvantages of the linear version worth to consider, it seems better to refrain using a more complex version.
