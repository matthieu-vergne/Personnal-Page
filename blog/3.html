<h1>Introduction to Advanced Generic Programming in Java</h1>

<h2>Who are the readers we target?</h2>

<p>
The readers we target are people who already have some basic experience in Java and show interest in Generic Programming.
We don't plan to give any detail about usual Java notions, like primitive data, objects, or classes, so the reader should already have a basic knowledge of Java.
Consequently, we already assume that you are a programmer and mainly focus on Generic Programming and Advanced Generic Programming features.
People interested in these topics can be identified through two perspectives.
</p>

<p>
One is throught the programming spectrum.
People interested in easy-to-maintain programs usually relies on simple designs, which are easy to understand and reusable in many situations.
People who want to create libraries for broad audiences are also usually caring about how to cover as much scenarios as possible with their library, which leads them to develop generic structures and procedures.
Thoses people are naturally driven towards using Java generics, which has been introduced in 2004 with J2SE 5.0.
With greater experience, Java programmers tend to use generic structures which can be reused elsewhere, leading them to learn about Design Patterns and other standard structures recognised to provide relevant features.
Those people are the first one to be interested in Advanced Generic Programming in Java.
</p>

<p>
A second relevant perspective is the ontological spectrum.
For those familiar with the word "ontology", be aware that we do not speak about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology">philosophical ontology</a>, which is about the idea of identifying the "real" structure of the world, what exists and what does not, how entities relate to each other and how they don't.
We speak here about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">ontology in Information Science</a>, with the aim to establish a <em>shared</em> conceptualisation of the world or of the domain targetted by a given community.
For those less familiar with the term, there might have people not particularly interested in programming, but who find a great interest in generic concepts and relationships.
Those generalists are more of the kind to care about a broad, consistent view of the world they live in rather than many, independent views of each domain they might come across, whatever the reason.
Those people, due to personal interest or professional constraints, might learn about programming in order to implement their models in a way that can be executed, whether it is for actual application or simulation.
These people may want their program to be as close as possible to the model they have in mind, leading them to care about languages allowing them to make a "copy-paste" of their model with as few refinements as possible to obtain an executable program.
Those people might find a great interest in learning about Generic Programing and Advanced Generic Programing too.

<h2>What is Generic Programming?</h2>

TODO (summary of post 4)

<h2>What is "Advanced" Generic Programming?</h2>

<p>
Generic Programming itself relates to the use of generic <em>concepts</em>, like Java generics<!-- TODO: Give other examples. -->.
Here, we are not targetting simply the use of generic concepts, but also their relations with other (generic) concepts, which implies to care about generic relationships, and thus generic structures.
Such structures refer usually to what we call <em>Design Patterns</em><!-- TODO -->
</p>

<h2>What (Advanced) Generic Programming <em>is not</em>?</h2>

TODO
Not about "solving the world"
Need to take decisions which can limit optimisation
