<h1>Basics of Generic Programing</h1>

<p>
When speaking about Generic Programming, Java programmers might think about <em>generics</em>, which have been introduced in the language with J2SE 5.0 in 2004, but Generic Programming is not about "programming with generics".
In this post, we will focus on what is Generic Programming about, to which extent it is supported by the Java language, and what remains to the programmers' skill.
</p>

<h2>First Things First: The Definitions</h2>

<p>
There is not a single interpretation about what Generic Programming is, and because we aim here to minimise subjective biases, let's start from the etymology of the words.
</p>

<p>
Starting with the easy one, <q>programming</q>, the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/programming">Merriam-Webster dictionary</a> shows that it can be interpreted in several ways, but our focus on Computer Science obviously lead us to speak about <q>the process of preparing an instructional program</q>.
Despite the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/program">even more numerous interpretations</a> the term <q>program</q> may have, the only definition which seems to fit our focus and to avoid recursive definitions is <q>a sequence of coded instructions that can be inserted into a mechanism (as a computer)</q>.
This analysis can be reproduced with other authorities, like the <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/programming">Oxford dictionary</a> and its <q>process of writing computer programs</q>, or the <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/programming">Cambridge dictionary</a> and its <q>activity or job of writing computer programs</q>.
Nothing hard here, this is the trivial one, but this kind of process can become rather heavy for people not used to it, so it is a good warm up before the main dish.
</p>

<p>
While the notion of <q>programming</q> is easy because it is more about selecting which definition corresponds to our situation, <q>generic</q> is harder because it is the one we want to understand, for which we lack the selection criteria, excepted that it should be compatible with a programming activity.
If we ignore definitions about brands and biology, which do not seem to apply to programming, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/generic">Merriam-Webster</a> defines something generic as <q>relating to or characteristic of a whole group or class</q> or <q>having no particularly distinctive quality or application</q>, in other words something which appears to be common within a set of things.
We can highlight that it is not about mere redundancy, meaning several occurrences in the group, but something which is redundant enough to be common to every members of the group.
The <a>Cambridge dictionary</a> remain on similar definitions, while the <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/generic">Oxford dictionary</a> also defines it as <q>not specific</q>, giving us a proper pair of opposites: generic versus specific.
</p>

<p>
From these definitions, we can then try to interpret the combination: generic programming is about producing programs which are common to a set of things.
We should not translate immediately <q>things</q> as <q>programs</q>, because nothing says that a generic thing is of the same kind that the entities sharing it, so we may also speak about programs common to several systems, which include not only software but also hardware, people, or organisations.
Thus, one could consider a generic program as a program found in several places, but then an issue of informativeness arises: if a program is generic as soon as we can find it in several places, does that mean that a mere copy is enough to call it generic?
Clearly, there is something wrong here, the intent being to speak about how a program can be <em>used</em> in several contexts, not just <em>present</em>, an interpretation motivated by the history of the concept.

<!-- TODO Link to my formalisation of the concept of genericness. -->
</p>

<h2>The Inception: Two Ways to Generalise</h2>

<p>
In 1984, <a href="GP1984">Goguen</a> introduces the notion of <q>Parameterized Programming</q>, with the idea of creating reusable programs which rely on parameters to provide more specific pieces of code.
These parameters, firstly thought for the Ada language, are also called interfaces and share some similarities with the Java interfaces.
Indeed, Ada did not provide any notion of interface before <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ada_Programming/Keywords/interface#Ada_2005">Ada 2005</a>, which inspires from the Java interface to build its own.
Ada is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming">modular programming language</a> which organises its code into modules -called packages- related to a specific purpose.
This Ada packages should not be confused with Java packages: Ada packages can contain methods, so they can be considered as the <a href="http://docs.adacore.com/gnat-ajis-docs/html/Mapping_Ada_to_Java.html">equivalent of Java classes</a>.
In the following, we speak about modules instead of Ada packages to avoid misunderstandings, so the reader may understand that an Ada module corresponds to a Java class.
In this context, Goguen defines an interface as a description of <q>all of the resources needed by the module</q>, which can be translated in Java as specifying an interface which provides the relevant methods to implement.
A parameter is then an abstract entity which is assumed to satisfy some requirements and Goguen interchangeably speaks about <q>instantiating a parameter</q> and <q>interfacing a module with an environment</q>.
In Java, we may speak about generics like <code>T</code> in <code>ArrayList&lt;T></code>, which is instantiated to <code>Integer</code> when we create an instance of <code>ArrayList&lt;Integer></code> or create a class which extends <code>ArrayList&lt;Integer></code>.
But it also relates to any method parameter, like <code>add(int a, int b)</code> which considers two integers to instantiate, for example by calling <code>add(3, 5)</code>.
As such, Goguen establishes a kind of Generic Programming which can be called <strong>top-down</strong>: we first identify the high level features required by the module into an interface, and then we instantiate them in specific contexts.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, this is in 1989 that <a href="#GP1989">Musser and Stepanov</a> coin the term <q>Generic Programming</q>, namely as <q>the definition of algorithms and data structures at an abstract or generic level</q>, again working mainly with the Ada language.
In their view, the focus is on generic algorithms, which are <q>parameterized procedural schemata that are completely independent of the underlying data representation and are derived from concrete, efficient algorithms</q>.
In other words, at the opposite of Goguen, they conceive a framework which aims at building generic programs in a <strong>bottom-up</strong> manner: starting from existing, low level running code, the goal is to identify common features to extract in higher levels for reuse.
This process, repeated iteratively, leads to the construction of a hierarchy of codes, where the highest levels provide the most generic parts to be reused in lower levels, until we reach executable code in the lowest parts.
As described by Musser and Stepanov, while Goguen aims for manipulating theories (especially for instantiating them for a specific context), they aim for building useful theories to manipulate, the usefulness being trivial because of the extraction from existing, useful code.
</p>

<!-- TODO What to do with that?
<p>
This <em>genericness-construction</em> framework focuses on a particular dimension to generalise: the algorithm should be independent of (i.e. generic in regard to) the data representation.
</p>
-->

<h2>Generic Programming Today</h2>

<p>
<a href="#Giovannelli2013">Giovannelli</a>, provides a description of how the early notion of Generic Programming has evolved towards a more focused idea of abstracting data types and how it was implemented in some programming languages, leading in particular to the introduction of generics in Java.
<!-- TODO -->
</p>

<h2>Top-Down Approach: What Makes a Program Generic?</h2>

<p>
The top-down approach of Goguen is strongly linked to theory building, with the aim of formalising a domain into well identified concepts, an approach greatly supported through Object-Oriented Programming.
In particular, Goguen identifies 12 requirements for supporting his top-down approach that we describe below, and we map each of them to features of the Java environment to see how it is supported.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Modularity:</strong> The program should be modular, such that it decomposes into modules with clearly identified purposes to maximise conceptual clarity, modifiability, and ease of understanding. As mentioned above, Java already supports modular programming through classes, but also with interfaces, the remaining effort being on the programmer side to identify clear and relevant concepts to implement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hierarchical Structure:</strong> A hierarchical structure should be provided, so one can easily track the dependencies between each module to understand and refine the program. Nowaday, one can use a search engine to find various tools to build the class hierarchy of a Java program into UML or other models, when it is not already integrated as an IDE feature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Libraries:</strong> It should be possible to implement libraries to provide various ready-for-use implementations. Implementing a library is also a good way to experiment on the interfaces to check their design and whether they properly cover their intended uses. Today, Java provides a rich standard library (e.g. collections and streams, threads, file management, arbitrary precision arithmetic) and various Java libraries are also available on the Web for extending it, potentially adding their own interfaces.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strong Typing:</strong> Conceptual consistency should be ensured through strong typing, such that a method designed for a particular use is not used in an improper way. Such improper uses should whether lead to a better formalisation (i.e. the theory fits, but it has not been correctly instantiated) or the choice of an alternative module (i.e. the theory does not fit). Java is such a strongly typed language.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parameterisation:</strong> Modules should support parameters to allow their adaptation to various contexts. In Java, this feature usually leads to think about generics (e.g. <code>T</code> in <code>List&lt;T></code>), but one should not forget the ability to specify methods with parameters, which is one of the oldest way used to customise a procedure. Java generics mainly <a href="entry:5">extend the strong typing check</a> performed by the compilator.</li>
<li><p><strong>Requirements for Parameters:</strong> Parameters should support constraints, such that one can restrict the application of a theory to cases which are actually compliant. Java do support such restrictions by specifying the type of a parameter (interface or class), including generics (e.g. <code>Handler&lt;C extends MessageContext></code> restricts the generics <code>C</code> to be a <code>MessageContext</code>). If there is some support for further constraints, like <code>assert</code>, people interested in a more extended control, like in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">design by contract</a>, should rely on third-party tools.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Theories and Views:</strong> One should be able to specify theories, the properties a generic module requires, and views, or how these properties are satisfied in a specific context. In Java, we respectively speak about an interface which provides specific methods, and the classes which describe how these methods are implemented. If Java theories are interfaces while Java views are classes, abstract classes play a (<a href="entry:11">optional</a>) role in between for more flexibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Information Hiding:</strong> Because the concrete implementations should be known only in the specific contexts they apply, the related information should be available only in this context, thus hiding information from external viewers. For example, a generic module A which provides an interface that can be implemented by a specific module B should not know how this interface will be implemented by B, but rely only on the specific information the interface of A builds on. In Java, this is achieved through the strong type checking and the use of keywords like <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, and <code>private</code>. Thus, if a method receives an object of type <code>Collection</code>, which is an interface, obviously it corresponds to an instance of a child class like <code>ArrayList</code> or <code>HashSet</code>, but the strong type check allows to use only the methods described in <code>Collection</code>. A manual (and valid) cast is required to retype this object into the child class before to use any additional feature the latter may provide. Keywords like <code>public</code> and <code>private</code> offer more flexibility regarding what should be known only by the class itself and what can be used by the user.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Module Modification:</strong> The modules should be modifiable, so one can adapt the module to its own context for improved reuse. In Java, this support is partial and focuses on the most preservative features: one can extend an interface or class to add methods, or modify some methods as long as it remains compatible with the old definition. The removal of functionality however is not supported, unless we consider throwing a <code>NotImplementedException</code> or alike as a feature removal rather than a proof of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)">low cohesion</a>, which threatens the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">single responsibility principle</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> A module should draw an economical and coherent theory, such that one can easily understand it for reuse. In particular, it should be clear what are the relevant types of information and how they are interacting, leading to specify both the required informational resources and the pattern of execution to follow. Java provides interfaces for the most abstract specifications and abstract classes when concrete execution flows are provided. Since Java 8, with some limits with the <code>default</code> keyword, it is also possible to implement methods in interfaces directly, which reinforces there usefulness for Generic Programming: they can now specify the resources required (typically through getters or other transformation methods) as well as the way to use them through default methods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Formal Semantics:</strong> Formal semantics are mathematical representations of a language, which allow for building proofs, whether it is about predicate satisfaction or general consistency of the language. Java, although it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language">formal language</a> and consequently does have some formalism to be properly interpreted by the machine, is not a <a href="">formal semantics</a>, which requires a mathematical translation of the various concepts and operations possible in Java. But some tools can be used to do formal verifications, like tools supporting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Modeling_Language">Java Modeling Language</a>, a formal semantics for the Java language.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interactive Program Development:</strong> It is important to be able to validate the program on the fly, without waiting for failures at runtime. Although not supported by Java itself, it is usually done by the development environment we rely on: immediate spell checking and frequent runs of unit tests are examples of interactive programming tasks.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Actually, a careful analysis of each of them should be done, because all of them are not <em>required</em> for Generic Programming, although they may facilitate the development process.
In particular, <em>interactive program development</em> is clearly useful for the developer as a way to facilitate the development, but it provides no feature which unlocks the ability to create generic programs.
Other bullets underline the necessity to understand well the program, like the <em>hierarchical structure</em>, the <em>libraries</em>, and <em>simplicity</em>, which are again nice helpers from a development perspective, but not fundamental for building generic programs, although we may recognise the economical and coherent theories as evidences of <em>good</em> Generic Programming, especially regarding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID principles</a>.
Other bullets are also for a more formal support of the validation of the program, like the <em>strong typing</em>, the <em>requirements for parameters</em>, the <em>information hiding</em>, and the <em>formal semantics</em>.
They clearly provide added value to the development process by enforcing genericity, and we may use them as arguments to explain why a design is more generic than another, but a generic program made with them still remain a valid (and generic) program once we remove them, showing their optional characteristics.
Finally, the main requirements to retain here, which actually unlock the ability to make generic programs, are the following: <em>modularity</em> to separate modules based on their purpose, in particular <em>theories and views</em> to separate generic and specific modules (the generic should be able to exist without the specific), <em>parameterisation</em> to allow the customisation of generic modules to fit the needs of specific ones, and <em>module modification</em> to allow the generic-to-specific adaptation.
In brief, we can mention <strong>three main properties of Generic Programming</strong> when we take a top-down perspective:
</p>
<ul>
<li>develop the modules <em>used</em> independently from the modules <em>users</em>,</li>
<li>make the former customizable through parameters,</li>
<li>support its adaptation in the latter in a flexible way.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As we mentioned, more than these three aspects are supported by Java (among other languages), which makes it a great language for Generic Programming.
</p>

<h2>Bottom-Up Approach: What Makes a Generic Program Useful?</h2>

<p>
At the opposite of the top-down approach described above, the bottom-up approach of Musser and Stepanov builds on existing code to factor.
In their view, it is about having a specific implementation, which depends on a specific data representation, from which to extract a generic implementation, which looses such a dependence for broader reuse.
By working on the <a href="#GP1987">implementation of an Ada library</a>, they have identified several kinds of abstractions to care about:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data Abstraction:</strong> Data types with operations defined on them. In Java, interfaces like <code>List</code> or <code>Set</code> can be considered as examples of data abstractions provided by the <code>java.util</code> package.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Algorithmic Abstraction:</strong> Families of data abstractions with common algorithms. We may consider the standard Java lists as a great example, with its interface <code>List</code> implemented in various ways (e.g. <code>LinkedList</code>, <code>ArrayList</code>, or <code>Vector</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Structural Abstraction:</strong> Intersections of algorithmic abstractions, like the <code>LinkedList</code> implementation which is not only a <code>List</code> but also a <code>Deque</code>, a <code>Cloneable</code>, and a <code>Serializable</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Representational Abstraction:</strong> Mappings from one structural abstraction to another, like the method <code>Arrays.&lt;T>asList(T... a)</code> which translates a generic array of items of type <code>T</code> into a generic <code>List&lt;T></code> of the same items.</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO So what? How can we use them? -->

<p>
Additionally, Musser and Stepanov spend some effort in validating their algorithms through formal verifications, an aspect that relates more to testing which we ignore here and keep as a potential future enrichment.
<!-- TODO Motivate the absence of testing or fix it. -->
However, they implicitly make the point by searching <q>the minimal assumptions [they] need to make about the generic parameters</q>.
A generic program is not just a factoring of some existing code, which implies that the factored code can be reused <em>where it was extracted from</em>, but a broader objective of making the factored code reusable in general, which means that it should be reusable <em>where it makes sense</em>.
As such, a generic programmer should identify a minimal set of assumptions which describes the situations in which it <em>makes sense</em> to reuse the generic program, independently of where it was generalised from.
Musser and Stepanov, for instance, had to pay a particular care that items in a list are not always indexed with integers.
Indeed, a linked list can vary by adding or removing items anywhere in the list, thus integer indexes can vary and should be considered only as a type of <em>coordinate</em> (the generic concept used by Musser and Stepanov) usable only for specific kinds of lists.
This is a perspective similar to the property described in the top-down approach, which requires to make the modules <em>used</em> independent from the modules <em>users</em>, and which is achieved by identifying the assumptions that the modules used (i.e. generic programs) actually require to be usable.
</p>

<h2>Which One: Top-Down or Bottom-Up?</h2>

<!-- TODO Advantage/limitations of top-down -->
Advantages:
- offers a robust set of features/architecture to build on
- save a significant amount of time if done correctly
Limitations:
- require a good abstraction skill
- require a solid corpus of domain knowledge for proper modelling
<!-- TODO Advantage/limitations of bottom-up -->
Advantages:
- quick to implement
- easy to understand and practice
Limitations:
- restricted by poor architecture design
- may require more iterations than top-down
<!-- TODO When top-down should get the priority -->
- Low level code has low priority (e.g. framework)
- Design code for multi-purpose reuse (e.g. library)
<!-- TODO When bottom-up should get the priority -->
- Abstraction has low priority (e.g. strong optimization need)
- Poor corpus of knowledge available (e.g. experimental project and prototypes)
<!-- TODO When both should be carefully balanced -->
- Huge projects (i.e. continuous alignment of generic and specific code)
- Combination or transition of purpose (e.g. extract a library from an experimental project)

------TO REVISE----------
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming">Generic Programing</a> is not a term which covers any programming aspect which might be considered as generic, but a particular aspect of programming languages.
Generic Programming focuses on the idea of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept">concepts</a></em>, which means an abstract category representing entities having a particular similarity.
Other terms can be used, like abstractions, classes, kinds, types, or categories.
For example, you are a <em>person</em>, but you are not the only one: individuals in your family are also persons, probably also your colleagues and friends (unless you consider some animals to be part of them too), and in general any entity which is a living human is considered to be a person.
You are not a concept, because you are something concrete, but "person" is a concept.
It is not a group of individuals, but it is a term which can be used to speak about any single individual considered to be a person, all of them sharing the common property of "being a person", whatever we mean by that.
If you are able to take a group of things and speak about it as "being a group of X", like your family is a group of persons, then X is a concept.
In metaphysics, people speak about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_(metaphysics)">universals</a>, but digging in the philosophical debates about universals and particulars is not our aim here.
We just try to give pointers to other notions which might help to understand the idea, because everyone do not have the same background.
</p>

<h2>Concepts in Java</h2>

<p>
Once this notion of <em>concept</em> is well understood, the point is to see how it is used in Java.
When programming, we implement various kinds of informational entities, like primitive data (e.g. booleans, integers, characters), composed data (e.g. arrays , structures), procedures (called functions or methods), or objects (i.e. combinations of data and procedures).
Because a concept represents any entity which has some given properties, the initial idea is to take one of these elements, consider some of its properties that we consider to be relevant, look at all the other entities which might share these properties, and consider that a specific concept represent them.
For instance, all the numbers sharing the property of having no decimal part are represented by the concept <em>integer</em>.
But this concept is just one concept, and there is many more we could use: a concept for each primitive data, a concept for each composed data having a particular structure, and so on.
These concepts has been usually implemented through the notion of <em>class</em>, for instance in Java we have a class <code>Integer</code> for integers, a class <code>Float</code> for real numbers, a class <code>StringBuilder</code> for objects which allow us to build a string (i.e. a chain of characters), but we can also describe our own <code>class</code> to create new concepts.
For example, a usual tutorial for teaching how to implement a class is the contact list: we know several persons and we want to save their contact information in a list from which we can easily retrieve them.
Each person is then represented by a class <code>Person</code> which provides the relevant data, like the name, age, phone number, and address of the person, with some interesting functions like functions to update the data or to format it into a single string.
</p>

<p>
But it is not that easy to implement the notion of concept.
Although classes are useful, they have their limits: a <code>Person</code>, as well as a <code>Pet</code>, might both have a name, but we don't want to create a function which displays the name of an entity for each class which might have a name.
This function needs to work at a higher level of abstraction, in other words use a concept which represents a smaller set of shared properties that applies to both <code>Person</code> and <code>Pet</code>.
To do so, people first use inheritance: a <em>child</em> class can extend a <em>parent</em> class, such that all the data and functions implemented in the parent class are also available in the child class.
In our example, we might have a <code>NamedEntity</code> class which stores and provide the name of the entity, while <code>Person</code> and <code>Pet</code> extend it to add their own, specific data and functions.
</p>

<p>
But once again, inheritance has its limits: some classes might share functions which, although they deal with the same kind of data, do not deal with them in the same way.
In our example, we might have the data of our entities stored in a database, with <code>Person</code> instances having their data in a specific table, let say <code>personData</code>, and <code>Pet</code> instances having their own <code>petData</code> table.
In this case, although both instances might have a <code>getName()</code> function in common, each of them need to retrieve it from a different table in the database.
This problem is solved by using <em>abstract functions</em> (virtual functions in C++), which are functions for which we do not specify the content, but for which we expect child classes to do it.
In our example, <code>NamedEntity</code> can be a class (an abstract class in Java) which requires the function <code>getName()</code> without providing its content.
It is then possible to create several of these "abstract classes", which provide specific abstract functions to represent specific properties, and make the child classes have the relevant properties by extending the right abstract classes.
In languages allowing multiple inheritance, like C++, it is just a matter of extending the right classes, while in languages not allowing it, like Java, people might need to pass through different mechanisms (e.g. Java interfaces).
</p>

<p>
But again, abstract functions don't solve all the problems.
In our example of contact list, we can use an array to store the <code>Person</code> instances we create, but a <code>List</code> class would be more interesting because it can provide functions to easily manage the items in the list.
Let assume we want our list to provide a function <code>add(item, index)</code> to add a new item at an arbitrary place in the list (and move the impacted items automatically) and a function <code>get(index)</code> to get the item stored at an arbitrary place in the list.
Such a <code>List</code> would not need any information about its items: the addition of the item only depends on where we want to put the new item in the list and where are the items already stored, and obtaining an item would depend only on the index provided by the user.
But if we take the most generic class for our <code>List</code> to be reusable in any situation, it means that an instance of this list can store anything at any time, while we would like our specific instance to store only <code>Person</code> items.
The motivation would be that we may want to use other kinds of list, like lists of phone numbers, but if we mix ourselves in the code and add a phone number to the list of contacts, we want to know about our mistake as soon as possible.
To do so, although we want the <code>List</code> to be generic and reusable, we want to instantiate it only for a specific kind of items that we can choose.
The answer is what is done with Generic Programming: give the ability to the programmer to implement one or several functions which use entities for which we don't know <em>yet</em> what they are.
</p>

<p>
This genericity is achieved through <em>generics</em> in Java, <em>templates</em> in C++
