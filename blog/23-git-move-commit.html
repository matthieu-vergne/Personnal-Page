<h1>How to Move a Git Commit in the History?</h1>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>
	You have created a commit at the wrong time in the commits history.
	For example, you want the commit to be merged, but it is mixed with others that should not be merged yet (or vice versa).
	Or the commit is independent from other commits, and keeping it there would just make the review more confusing, so you want to place it first/last.
	Anyway, the order of the commit is not satisfying, so you want it to be elsewhere in the branch.
</p>

<h2 id="question">Question</h2>

<p>
	How to move a Git commit in the history?
</p>

<h2 id="method">Method</h2>

<include src="git-rewrite-warning.html"/>
<p>
	Notice that Git does not allow to modify the first commit.
	It means that you cannot move a commit earlier in the history than the second place.
	<strong>These procedures will simply, and badly, fail if you try to move your commit first.</strong>
	Since you are not supposed to do it, just don't do it.
</p>
<p>
	Notice also that moving the commit last means there is no remaining commit.
	Each procedure comes with a command to retrieve the remaining commits.
	If you move the commit last, this command will fail but the procedure will terminate properly.
</p>
<p>
	Once the points of caution are clear, reordering commits can be done in several ways.
	If you need to move only parts of it, <entry id="22">split the commit</entry> first.
	If you need to move a sequence of commits, either move them one at a time or <entry id="26">squash them</entry> first to move all of them at once.
	It is possible to move a sequence of commits as is, but the resolution of conflicts remains a potential issue.
	In this article, we deal with this aspect for each commit separately, but feel free to adapt it to a full sequence.
	Once you are ready to go, you must identify the commit to move:
</p>
<pre><code>
COMMIT=&lt;commit SHA-1&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
	The commits are recreated during the operation, thus changing their hash.
	This variable must be updated after each operation to consider this change.
	The provided procedures include this update to ease the work, so you only need to define it once.
</p>

<h3 id="method-before-single">Move a Commit 1 Step Before</h3>

<p>
	If your commit does not overlap with the one before (no conflict is expected), you can just swap their order:
</p>
<pre><code>
COMMIT_LAST=$(git rev-parse HEAD)          # Identify the last commit
git reset --hard ${COMMIT}~2               # Place the branch on the commit before the ones to swap
git cherry-pick ${COMMIT} ${COMMIT}~1      # Apply the commits in a swapped order
NEW_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)           # Save the new commit hash
git cherry-pick ${COMMIT}..${COMMIT_LAST}  # Apply the remaining commits
COMMIT=${NEW_HASH}                         # Update the commit hash for next move
</code></pre>
<p>
	If the commit to move overlaps with the commit to swap, you will have conflicts to resolve.
	If you are fine resolving the conflicts, then just apply the procedure above.
	The potential conflicts occur on the first <code>cherry-pick</code>.
	Otherwise, you may prefer to reproduce the change manually during the <code>&lt;editing&gt;</code> step below:
</p>
<pre><code>
COMMIT_LAST=$(git rev-parse HEAD)                       # Identify the last commit
git reset --hard ${COMMIT}~2                            # Place the branch on the commit before the ones to swap
&lt;editing&gt;                                               # Reproduce the change of the commit to move
git add .                                               # Stage the change
git commit -m "$(git log --format=%B -n 1 ${COMMIT})"   # Commit it with the initial commit message
NEW_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD)                          # Save the new commit hash
git revert -n HEAD                                      # Revert the change without commiting
git cherry-pick -n ${COMMIT}~1 ${COMMIT}                # Reproduce the 2 original changes without commiting
git commit -m "$(git log --format=%B -n 1 ${COMMIT}~1)" # Commit the result with the swapped commit message
git cherry-pick ${COMMIT}..${COMMIT_LAST}               # Apply the remaining commits
COMMIT=${NEW_HASH}                                      # Update the commit hash for next move
</code></pre>
<p>
	If you don't like to reproduce the change, you can instead <em>remove</em> the change of the <em>swapped commit</em>.
	For that, just use the reverse procedure below to move the swapped commit after instead of moving the initial commit before.
</p>

<h3 id="method-before-multiple">Move a Commit Several Steps Before</h3>

<p>
	One way to move your commit is to repeat the procedures above.
	Identify your commit, select the right procedure (simple swap vs. manual editing), and repeat.
	At each step, you need to choose the right procedure depending on your potential conflicts with the next commit to swap with.
	By sequencing them properly, you should reach the place you want with your commit.
</p>
<p>
	Another way to go is to move the commit directly n steps before.
	If your commit does not overlap with <em>any</em> of the n commits before it, you can move it directly there:
</p>
<pre><code>
N=&lt;steps&gt;                                       # Identify the number of commits to jump
COMMIT_LAST=$(git rev-parse HEAD)               # Identify the last commit
git reset --hard ${COMMIT}~$((N+1))             # Place the branch on the commit before the ones to jump
git cherry-pick ${COMMIT}                       # Apply the commit to move
NEW_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD)                  # Save the new commit hash
git cherry-pick ${COMMIT}~$((N+1))..${COMMIT}~1 # Apply the commits to jump
git cherry-pick ${COMMIT}..${COMMIT_LAST}       # Apply the remaining commits
COMMIT=${NEW_HASH}                              # Update the commit hash for next move
</code></pre>
<p>
	If the commit to move overlaps with one or several commits, you will have conflicts to resolve.
	If you are fine resolving the conflicts, then just apply the procedure above.
	The potential conflicts occur on the first and second <code>cherry-pick</code>.
</p>
<p>
	If you don't want to resolve the conflicts, you may prefer to reproduce the change manually.
	The point is that you need to reproduce it at least for each commit that conflicts.
	If you don't want to spend time finding which commits may conflict, you can reproduce the change for each commit.
	In this case, you can apply this procedure in 4 phases:
</p>
<pre><code>

<h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

<p>
	To move a Git commit in the history, you can use various Git commands:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>git reset --hard</code> to "cut" the branch, forgetting the last commits before to reproduce them as wanted</li>
	<li><code>git cherry-pick</code> to reproduce specific commits, with the <code>-n</code> option to only reproduce their changes without actually committing them</li>
	<li><code>git revert -n</code> to revert the last changes in preparation of the next commit</li>
	<li><code>git add .</code> to stage all the current changes, including manual ones if needed</li>
	<li><code>git commit</code> to actually create the clean commits</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Simples procedures, based on <code>reset</code> and <code>cherry-pick</code>, allow to easily recreate a commits history by picking them in the right order.
	However, it works well when the commits do not overlap (too much) each other, to reduce the conflicts to the minimum.
	If conflicts are an issue, it is possible to use the other commands to pick and adapt the changes we need.
	Depending on whether you move your commit <em>before</em> or <em>after</em>, manual editions will <em>reproduce</em> or <em>remove</em> the change.
</p>
<p>
	You have some flexibility in chosing your edition strategy.
	Indeed, for a single step, both strategies aim to swap 2 commits, let's say change 1 then change 2.
	One strategy is to move change 2 <em>before</em>, which means <em>reproducing</em> change 2.
	The other stragegy is to move change 1 <em>after</em>, which means <em>removing</em> change 1.
	In other words, you cannot choose only a specific change, but you can reproduce one or remove the other.
</p>
<p>
	However, this flexibility is significantly reduced when moving a commit by several steps.
	Indeed, if change 1 is the commit to move, change 2 is the sequence of commits after it.
	Either you reproduce always change 1, or you remove each change provided by each commit of change 2.
	Of course, the same reasoning applies in the other direction.
</p>
<p>
	In other words, it is often a good thing to focus on the commit to move, and be able to reproduce or remove it as required.
	Usually, though, we work on the most recent commits, which means moving them before rather than after.
	Consequently, we need more often to reproduce a change rather than removing it, which is often simpler because more usual.
</p>
<p>
	To summarize, we can move a single commit where we want in the history without having to deal with conflicts nor deeply understand the whole history.
	As long as we can easily deal with the conflicts or easily reproduce the commit, it is not that complex to reorder the commits.
	And if you find it difficult, think about <entry id="22">splitting your commits</entry> first to reduce their complexity.
