If you understand that I am a disorganised and rebellious guy who spends his time complaining about everything, I strongly recommend you to carefully read the associated links. I am rather strict in my organisation and methods, seeking for perfection for myself, but extremely open to new or debatable perspectives other people may have.</p>";

For the ones who wonder how a scientist can be a relativist, I would answer that relativism does not go <em>against</em> science, but rather <em>includes</em> it: a relativist can take a scientific perspective to write a scientific paper, and keep unscientific positions for other contributions. Being an epistemological anarchist also does not mean that I consider globally recognised methods as useless, only that any method should be considered as still perfectible (this is consequential to my skeptical side) and that no method should be rejected on the sole behalf of not being a globally recognised one.</p>";
